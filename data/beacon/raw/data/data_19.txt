programme by the same station in July 2006. "La Ronda" was a children's programme broadcast from noon until 2:00 p.m. (local time) on Sundays. During a recent broadcast, host Marta Savorido, who is
also a teacher, invited the provincial government to pay more attention to her fellow teachers' wage demands. When the station's management announced the programme's removal on 5 March, it said this
type of comment should not be made "on a public radio station."

private radio and television broadcasting stations must seek advance permission from the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) before conducting live broadcasts, according to a statement
released by the agency on Tuesday. The directive threatened violators with unspecified punishment. "Of late, MACRA has noted with great concern that hate messages are being broadcast by various
broadcasting stations," the statement said.

to suspend the interview. She did not comply. The following day, the broadcast of the programme was halted 15 minutes after it started. According to Nicotra, the station's owner, Douglas Valero,

Calderón Hinojosa. The station succumbed to debts after confronting, throughout the six-year tenure of former president Vicente Fox Quesada, various economic and administrative pressures, as well as a
legal wrangle with Grupo Radio Centro over the latter's arbitrary 2004 decision to cancel its broadcast of Radio Monitor's programmes. The debts were caused by the withdrawal of government advertising
contracts due to pressure by Fox and his wife. These pressures also led to the cancellation of private advertising contracts, leaving Radio Monitor without the income needed for survival. The
publicity boycott was in retaliation for Radio Monitor's having covered the campaign of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Fox's rival in the 2006 elections.

Radio Broadcasters' Association of Caaguazú (Asociación de Radiodifusión Comercial de Caaguazú, ARADELCA). The same organization, which campaigned strongly against the non-renewal of RCTV's
broadcasting license in Venezuela, describing it as an "attack on freedom of expression", also brought about, through the local courts, the 7 July closure of the radio station Radio Carayao in the
city of the same name. Caaguazú department, where these closures took place, is the political riding of the country's president, Nicanor Duarte Frutos. According to local sources, the president owns
more than one commercial radio station in the department, run by "name-lenders" or "front men" - people paid to be the official, public owners of a business actually owned by someone else, to conceal
the identity of the real owner. The station was closed in response to pressure from business interests; allocation of frequencies politically biased, says AMARC.

*505  $aPresident General Pervez Musharraf declared the state of emergency on 3 November 2007. The measures to control and restrain the media included suspension of broadcasts of all international
news channels as well as national private television channels throughout the country until further notice. Cable operators have been directed to only broadcast entertainment programmes. A number of
websites of international and national news organisations were also blocked on November 3. Telephone and SMS service in the capital city of Islamabad were also suspended for some hours on that day.
Authorities also raided a private television channel and two private FM radio stations, confiscating equipment of one radio station. There have been a number of attacks on journalists covering protest
against the imposition of emergency measures. The government has also made important changes to the laws relating to the media. The Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO), which has replaced the
permanent constitution of the country, specifically suspends Article 19 of the constitution relating to freedom of the press. In addition the government has introduced two separate ordinances imposing
severe curbs on print and electronic media.

*505  $aThe governmental Air Transport Office (ATO) prevented aerial news coverage by a local television news network of one of the largest protest rallies against President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on
29 February 2008. ATO declared the air space above Makati City, where the rally was held, a "no fly zone". The news helicopter of ABS-CBN, one of the largest news conglomerates in the country, could
not take off as a result, thus preventing reporting and filming from the air that could have given the public an idea of how large the rally was. The ATO directive was issued upon the request of the
Philippine National Police (PNP) on 27 February. The PNP website said that the ATO directive was "another precautionary measure" to ensure the safety of those attending the rally. But ATO Executive
Director Daniel Dimagiba was quoted as saying that the directive was aimed at stopping speculations that protestors were under surveillance by government forces during the event. [...] The ban lasted
from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. (local time), the approximate duration of the rally.

programme scheduled to run two days later, and was asked to turn over its investigative file on the subject of the feature. According to "Séptimo Día" general producer Francisco Bohórquez, that
edition of the programme was going to feature an investigative report on a situation involving a beautician who had apparently performed surgical procedures, inappropriately and illegally. The main
source for the feature was one of the beautician's former clients, who has had serious health problems as a consequence of the procedures and wanted to draw public attention to her experience. After
receiving the court order, signed by Prosecutor Edna Patricia Cabrera, the managers of both Caracol and "Séptimo Día" opted not to broadcast the feature. The order, which was issued as part of a
criminal investigation of the beautician for personal injuries and medical responsibilities, reads: "You are asked to deliver all of the information obtained by you to this office, in order to clarify
the incidents in question.(. . .) Taking into account that the investigation we are engaged in, and the evidence provided for it, are necessary and are confidential, you are ordered to abstain from

*505  $aOn 2 June 2008, the directors of Planeta 98.7 radio station suspended the "Vallenatos y algo más" news and entertainment programme after its host, Yon Espinel, criticised the poor condition of
the streets in the town of Sabaneta, municipality of Alberto Arvelo Torrealba, Barinas state, in southeastern Venezuela. The journalist said that the programme's suspension was due to pressure exerted
by Mayor Aníbal Chávez. [...] "The radio station's owner told me that he could not withstand the pressure being exerted by the mayor any longer and that he did not want the radio station to be closed
down or to have any more problems," Espinel told IPYS.
