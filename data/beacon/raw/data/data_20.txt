*505  $aThree representatives from the National Communications Commission (CNC), accompanied by three federal police officers, went to Freeway FM studios in San Martín, near the capital, at 10 a.m.
(local time) on 23 June 2008 with a seizure order from San Martín criminal court judge Martina Isabel Forns and confiscated all of its broadcast equipment. The judge issued her order in response to a
complaint by radio Disney, which claimed that the frequency used by Freeway FM was too close to its own. [...] Law 22.285, the legal basis for the confiscation order, was promulgated when Gen. Jorge
Videla was military president. It imposes drastic condition on the creation of radio stations and intervenes in their programme content, requiring that they "contribute to the strengthening of
national unity and reinforcement of faith and hope in the Argentine nation's destiny" (article 14, subsection c).

administrative centre of Xochistlahuaca, Guerrero state, western Mexico. According to information obtained from local sources, at about noon on 10 July, approximately 40 officers, 30 of whom were
armed, arrived at the indigenous radio station's broadcasting centre in the community of Suljaa' in Guerrero with an order to close the station and confiscate its equipment. The officers entered the
radio station, took photographs and began to disconnect equipment. When the community realised what was happening, approximately 300 people arrived at the broadcasting centre and the surrounding area
of Cerro de la Flores in order to stop the closure and dismantling of the station. According to the information sources, the attempt by the officers to disconnect the equipment "started a fire in the
transmitter and computer that are used to broadcast."

to suspend NTDTV (New Tang Dynasty Television) on 16 June because of a technical problem, but a recorded conversation with an employee of Eutelsat shows it was a premeditated, politically-motivated
decision violating the free flow of information and the convention under which Eutelsat operates. [...] In a recorded conversation on 23 June with an interlocutor the employee thought was a Chinese
Propaganda Department official, a Eutelsat representative in Beijing said: "It was our company's CEO in France who decided to stop NTDTV's signal. (. . .) We could have turned off any of the
transponders. (. . .) It was because we got repeated complaints and reminders from the Chinese government. (. . .) Two years ago, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television kept saying the
same thing over and over: 'Stop that TV station before we begin to talk.'" [...] A New York-based TV station with links to the Falun Gong spiritual movement, NTDTV began broadcasting in Chinese four
years ago.

*505  $aAn Internet provider in Kirov region has blocked access to the website of the newspaper "Vyatsky Nablyudatel" at the request of the local law enforcement agencies. The decision was made over a
comment posted on the paper's website, which law enforcement agencies found to be defamatory to a regional government official. Hosting Systems, the company that hosts the newspaper's website (
http://www.nabludatel.ru ), blocked access to the site following a complaint from the local interior affairs department. Representatives of the department stated that the paper's website contained
statements defaming the deputy governor of the Kirov region, calling for extremist activities (a crime under Article 280 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), and fanning hatred or feud (a
crime under Article 282). The paper's editor-in-chief, Sergei Bachinin, admits that the posting in question was unacceptable. "We are trying to delete all such postings, but we missed this particular
one," he said.

shut down, she is unemployed and her movements are sometimes restricted. She has been under house arrest in Beijing since March 10, 2008, when unrest began in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. Woeser has
become widely known as one of China's most respected writers on Tibet, and has used the Internet to provide reports on the situation in Tibet and of Tibetans throughout China.

*505  $aResearch published today by OpenNet Initiative says that more than 50 Web sites related to news, human rights, and pro-Tibet groups were blocked in Beijing and in the Olympics' Main Press
Center as the Games were about to begin. Those sites included the Web site of the Committee to Protect Journalists, http://www.cpj.org . OpenNet Initiative, an academic partnership that studies
Internet censorship issues, said that a small handful of sites were made available on August 1, after journalists complained that access at the press center was being restricted. The brief OpenNet
Initiative report, published on the group's blog, does not specify the current status of the affected sites, although reports by CPJ and others indicate that many have remained blocked. CPJ's Web site
was still blocked in the Main Press Center today, according to CPJ research. OpenNet Initiative, which described its testing as a "snapshot of Internet filtering in China leading up to week one of the
Olympics," found a range of sites blocked. They included news sites such as China Digital Times; those affiliated with press freedom causes, such as Reporters Without Borders and CPJ; and sites
associated with human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, Human Rights in China, and the Dui Hua Foundation, which advocates on behalf of political detainees.

August, the authorities asked local TV stations not to broadcast reports liable to "excite" the population until further order. TV executives and editors were summoned and told it would be preferable
if they suspended news programmes and just broadcast entertainment. The government claimed that reports broadcast by certain stations violated the Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act 1995. It
was on the basis of this law that, on 24 August, a Srinagar judge finally ordered the TV stations to suppress their news programmes and just carry entertainment.

compound of Thailand's state-run National Broadcasting Television (NBT). Electricity was cut at the station and, at 8:30 a.m. (local time), NBT officials were forced to suspend operations pending
efforts by station managers and the police to restore order. It is not yet certain who cut off the electricity at the station, but NBT officials said it was definitely not on their orders. [...]
Programming has been suspended and most of NBT's staff have left the premises. As of 10:00 a.m. on 26 August, NBT was broadcasting from an older station it owns in downtown Bangkok, covering its own

Juan de los Morros, capital of Guárico, according to press reports and CPJ interviews. The soldiers were accompanying the Conatel [National Telecommunications Commission] officials who ordered the
closure of the two stations and the seizure of their equipment, the local daily El Nacionalista reported. The stations - housed in the same building but owned separately - remained off the air today,
said a local journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity. In a statement issued on Monday, Conatel said it took action against the two stations because they were operating illegally. Peter Taffin,
president of Rumbera Network, and Alex Velásquez, director of Llanera 91.3 FM, told local reporters that the radio stations had been operating without proper licensing but were in the process of
obtaining the necessary permits.

*505  $aAround 6:30 p.m. on Monday 25 August, at least 20 members of the Venezuelan army raided and then sealed the offices of local radio stations Rumbera Network 101.5 FM and Llanera 91.3 FM in San
Juan de los Morros, capital of Guárico, according to press reports and CPJ interviews. The soldiers were accompanying the Conatel [National Telecommunications Commission] officials who ordered the
closure of the two stations and the seizure of their equipment, the local daily El Nacionalista reported. The stations - housed in the same building but owned separately - remained off the air today,
said a local journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity. In a statement issued on Monday, Conatel said it took action against the two stations because they were operating illegally. Peter Taffin,
president of Rumbera Network, and Alex Velásquez, director of Llanera 91.3 FM, told local reporters that the radio stations had been operating without proper licensing but were in the process of
obtaining the necessary permits.

*505  $aNimendra Shahi, a news correspondent and announcer for Radio Bajura, was removed from his job on 25 August 2008, by Pisbin Bajura radio network, in Bajura, far western Nepal. According to
Arjun Shah, president of the FNJ's Bajura chapter, Shahi was running the radio programme "Halkhabar". On that programme he broadcast a news report, entitled "Chinese Bed for Prime Minister", which,
despite being balanced, provoked a very negative reaction from the Maoist party. The manager then cancelled the programme, apparently due to indirect pressure by the Maoists. In the meantime, a local
weekly newspaper, "Malika Time", published a comment by Shahi indicating that Pisbin radio network was weak to bow to such pressures and cancel the programme. Pisbin fired Shahi from the radio station
for making that comment. Subsequently, following pressure by the FNJ Bajura chapter, the programme was reinstated, but Shahi was not.

located in the city of Huajuapan de León, Oaxaca state, southeastern Mexico. Three of the radio station's staff members were at the station when the police officers entered and informed them of their
intention to stop the station from broadcasting. The government officials said that they were just carrying out an "administrative action" but that if they encountered resistance they would call for
assistance from the Public Ministry (Ministerio Público) on grounds that a federal crime was being committed.

powder contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine has reportedly caused the deaths of two babies and caused more than 1200 to fall ill. The restrictions, issued after the case became widely
reported in the media, consist of five points, including a command only to publish information obtained from official government news sources such as Xinhua News Agency and China Daily. The orders
also insist on positive reporting of the government's handling of the crisis, and demotion of the story on online forums or blogs. Above all, the restrictions bar any criticism of government or health

*505  $aThe websites of Mizzima News, an independent Burmese news agency based in New Delhi, India, have been hacked, rendering the websites inaccessible since the early morning of 1 October 2008.
According to Mizzima's webmaster, the attackers took advantage of the sites' code weakness. Even as files from the English and Burmese websites were deleted from the database, and had to be recovered
from the back-up, the http://www.mizzima.tv/ , http://www.mizzima.com and http://www.mizzimaphoto.com websites were temporarily down. Although the problems with the mizzima.com, mizzima.tv and
mizimaphoto.com websites were rectified, the Burmese site, http://www.mizzimaburmese.com , remained inaccessible as of 1 October. Although it is not known who is behind the attack, the hacker's
internet protocol (IP) is found to have originated from a server in the United States. Mizzima, however, is still unable to confirm whether the attack is the work of the Burmese military junta, which
has banned Mizzima's websites inside the country.

his cronies. That gave rise to the beginning of legal proceedings against the website under articles 280 ("Public calls for the forcible change of the RF constitutional order") and 282 ("Instigation

*505  $aThe independent electronic publication Tunisnews ( http://www.tunisnews.net ) has announced that its site was the target of a hacking attack on 5 November 2008, and that the administrators of
the site have succeeded in overcoming the attack. The Tunisnews site was the target of a similar act of Internet piracy last April, which rendered it inaccessible for several days. Also on 5 November,
the site of the opposition Progressive Democratic Party ( Parti Démocratique Progressiste, PDP - http://www.pdpinfo.org ) was the target of an act of sabotage that completely destroyed its archives.
The images illustrating the articles were replaced with the skull of a pirate. It is the fourth time this year that the PDP's site has been the object of such an attack. This past October, the online
webzine "Kalima" ( http://www.kalimatunisie.com ) was also attacked and its content completely destroyed. The site of opposition activist Moncef Marzouki ( http://www.moncefmarzouki.net ) was also
hacked. Ongoing acts of filtering and destruction of email boxes of journalists and human rights activists have intensified over the past months, particularly targeting users of Yahoo mail. As well, a
number of blogs have been censored. The Observatory for the Freedom of Press, Publishing and Creation in Tunisia (OLPEC) notes that these acts of Internet piracy coincide with remarks made by the
prime minister in a 3 November speech marking the opening of the annual symposium of the ruling Constitutional Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique, RCD). In his statements,
the head of state called for the consolidation of control and censorship of the Internet in the name of "protecting the democratic process, political stability and the fight against terrorism."

*505  $aThe independent electronic publication Tunisnews ( http://www.tunisnews.net ) has announced that its site was the target of a hacking attack on 5 November 2008, and that the administrators of
the site have succeeded in overcoming the attack. The Tunisnews site was the target of a similar act of Internet piracy last April, which rendered it inaccessible for several days. Also on 5 November,
the site of the opposition Progressive Democratic Party ( Parti Démocratique Progressiste, PDP - http://www.pdpinfo.org ) was the target of an act of sabotage that completely destroyed its archives.
The images illustrating the articles were replaced with the skull of a pirate. It is the fourth time this year that the PDP's site has been the object of such an attack. This past October, the online
webzine "Kalima" ( http://www.kalimatunisie.com ) was also attacked and its content completely destroyed. The site of opposition activist Moncef Marzouki ( http://www.moncefmarzouki.net ) was also
hacked. Ongoing acts of filtering and destruction of email boxes of journalists and human rights activists have intensified over the past months, particularly targeting users of Yahoo mail. As well, a
number of blogs have been censored. The Observatory for the Freedom of Press, Publishing and Creation in Tunisia (OLPEC) notes that these acts of Internet piracy coincide with remarks made by the
prime minister in a 3 November speech marking the opening of the annual symposium of the ruling Constitutional Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique, RCD). In his statements,
the head of state called for the consolidation of control and censorship of the Internet in the name of "protecting the democratic process, political stability and the fight against terrorism."

knocked down, but rather fell because of strong winds. Rurrenabaque is located in the department of Beni, northeastern Bolivia.

province's interior. The legal process regarding this incident has experienced delays and the radio station's representatives have said their attempts to access the files on the case have been
obstructed. The radio station's director, Silvia Niño, [...] said that she has only been given access to the information in the report via a telephone conversation she had with the fire chief. She
added that the report actually does contain information saying that the fire was set intentionally. She also noted that she has been denied access to the legal case files. FOPEA has repeatedly asked
provincial government representatives for access to the police and firefighters report but the response has been slow in coming and, to date, the request has yet not been fulfilled.

*505  $aOn 4 November 2008, the state-controlled TV station, SLRC - ordered by the government authorities - abruptly stopped a live TV discussion on the recently-imposed Private Television
Broadcasting Station Regulations without giving any reasons to the audience. The SLRC had invited FMM Convener Uvindu Kurululasuriya to participate in the discussion to represent media organisations.
The other two panelists were Mr. Chritha Harath, adviser to the media minister, and Mr. Damma Disanayaka, a university lecturer. After 45 minutes, the discussion was stopped suddenly, a commercial
break was announced and stations started to play songs that replaced the live discussion.

Transportes y Comunicaciones, MTC), burst into the headquarters of Radio Caplina radio station, cancelled its broadcasting signal and seized all of its equipment. The incident took place in Tacna,
southern Peru, which was declared to be in a state of emergency on 4 November after the region's residents began a violent protest against the passage of a new mining royalties law. Two army tanks
were left parked outside Radio Caplina's headquarters. The station's legal advisor, Henry Portugal, told IPYS that the actions against Radio Caplina could be in retaliation for the fact that the
station has allowed the region's residents to express themselves live on air to complain about the distribution of mining royalties.

effectively transferring its ownership into the hands of politicians. MACRA challenged the injunction obtained by Joy Radio and High Court Judge Joseph Manyungwa ruled in favour of the regulatory body
on 19 November. The ruling allows MACRA to implement its earlier decision to close down the station. Following the ruling, MACRA wrote to Joy Radio on 20 November ordering the station to stop its

rejected, has yet to be cleared by the Press Scrutiny Board (censor board), the Rangoon-based media circle said. The original cover design of the January edition of "Myanmar Thit" magazine
commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of U Thant with his portrait on its cover. The publishers, however, had to change their cover design after the censor board disapproved of it. But the

were inclined "to oppose the actions of legitimate institutions of the Republic." Kabingwa went on to forbid radio and television stations from broadcasting messages designed to "create confusion and
misunderstanding among the population as to the actions of the legitimate authority" or even to organise broadcasts that might be viewed as "subversive" or "rebellious". He assured stations that
failure to abide by the new code would result in administrative and legal penalties, up to and including the revoking of transmission signals and/or the confiscation of transmission equipment.

shall cease. Members of the public used to phone in to express views on and discuss a number of issues. The government and the ruling party, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), argue
that the shows are being abused to attack the party and government leaders. An arm of the ruling party, the SWAPO Elders Council, and the NBC called for a review of the chat shows in 2008.

and arrested two journalists, Aubrey Nazombe and Mary Chande Mhone, a technician, Abdulazagv Telera, and a driver, Yusuf Yasin, accusing them of "violating electoral law". They also seized the tape of
the programme. Although the radio station apologised and admitted making a mistake, the authorities initially banned all live programmes and ordered it to only play music. During the evening they
decided to shut down the station completely.

since 1999 on Stereo Rey 97.1 FM in the state of Barinas, western Venezuela. España told IPYS that the station's owner, Ángel María Pérez, confessed when giving him the news that if he did not cancel
his programme the radio station would be closed down. The program deals mainly with teachers' rights in the region. España attempted to get in touch with Pérez again in order to get the official
version of the reason for the programme's cancellation, but received no reply. In a conversation with IPYS, Pérez denied being subjected to political pressure, stating that the programme was cancelled
because of internal issues.

*505  $aThe Transport and Communications Ministry (Ministerio de Transportes y Comunicaciones) has banned broadcasting by the La Voz de Bagua Grande radio station, in the town of Bagua Grande,
northwestern Peru. The radio station's licence was cancelled by ministerial decree on 8 June 2009, but, since 13 March 2007, it has had a ten-year frequency authorisation. This agreement allowed La
Voz de Bagua Grande a 12-month period for authorisation and installation. The station's director, Carlos Flores Borja, said he sent the ministry the documents required for certification on 29 January.
These documents, supported by the municipality of Utcubamba, also said that the radio's initial site had to be changed for safety reasons. The ministry used this reason, allegedly based on an
"unfavourable opinion" issued on 31 December 2008 to cancel the frequency authorisation before the end of the probationary period. In fact, La Voz de Bagua Grande has been in the government's sights
since the clashes shook the Amazon region at the start of June. At the height of the rioting, on 5 June 2009, in which around 30 people died, the interior minister, Mercedes Cabanillas, publicly
threatened to close the radio along with Radio Oriente, another station based in Yurimaguas, for their alleged "support" for violence against the security forces.

their motives are, however, unknown. On 7 May 2009, the National Telecommunications Commission (Comisión Nacional de Telecomunicaciones, CONATEL) initiated proceedings against Globovisión television

of the topic of popular resistance to the coup d'état in Honduras. The CDM's "Tiempo de Hablar" programme was taken off the air at 8:35 a.m. (local time), just as its invited guests for the day were
about to be begin discussing the topic of "resisting the coup d'état." The host of "Tiempo de Hablar", Deysi Flores, said her guests were only able to cover three subjects regarding the issue of the
coup, one of them being a call for prayers for Honduras. Subsequently, the CEM-H programme "La Bullaranga", hosted by Lídice Ortega, was taken off the air at 11:00 a.m. Radio Cadena Voces technicians
and administrators told the radio programme hosts that all of the station's broadcasts had gone off the air and that they did not know why the decision to cut the broadcasts had been made. However,
they confirmed that, minutes after the programmes were taken off the air, the radio station began broadcasting religious music.

from the Diyarbakir Chief Public Prosecutor, Judge Dursun Karaman decreed the confiscation of the paper. Around 1,000 copies of the issue were collected by evening.

*505  $aCabinet has reaffirmed its stand on the continued monitoring and evaluation of Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) radio phone-in programs. Through government pressure, the NBC had earlier
this year made drastic and controversial changes to its programs to prevent what the authorities called "abuse of the right to freedom of speech". The original programs were completely removed from
the air and replaced with new ones which are strictly monitored by the government and have very limited air time. The NBC warned that the government would monitor the programs and that they would be
completely removed from the air if the measures were ineffective. The original programs featured various educational and developmental discussions by the public and their ban from the air in March
2009 sparked more criticism from the public.
