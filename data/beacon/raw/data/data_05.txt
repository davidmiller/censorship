*505  $a"London-nytt", first published on September 15 1941, was one of 
the largest illegal papers, started by Helge Weiby, and the brothers 
Sigurd and Bjarne Riisa. Early in 1942, Helge Weiby and Erling 
Hermansen fled to Sweden. As circulation grew, the paper became more 
vulnerable, and in February/April 1942 the Gestapo arrested several of 
the group. Alf B. Bergersen was deported to Germany and died in 
Oranienburg. Scot Ferdinand Presthus, Sigurd Riisa, Thorvald Martinius 
Toennesen and Theodor Boee were kept in Grini camp until the liberation. 
Solveig Lystad was arrested in May, deported to Ravensbruck and 
released at the liberation. Arne Lyng (Simonsen) was arrested in June 
1943, and deported to Sachsenhausen. More arrests were probably made

*505  $aThis paper, a direct continuation of London-nytt. [1], 
immediately resumed publishing in 1942, now with new members, lead by 
the remaining member of the original group, Ellen Jacobsen. In July 
1942, the paper was again raided. Ca. 40 distributors and members were 
arrested, but the paper continued, now with three issues per week. At 
the end of 1942, the Gestapo again made a raid, due to informers. 
Herlov Rygh, Per Alveberg, Ellen Jacobsen and Fritz Lund were arrested. 
Andreas Riis became editor, and continued until many members were 
arrested on February 3 1944. Petter Moen, Reidar Ostlid and Sverre Lie 
died when the prisonership Westphalen sank on September 6 1944. The 
group also published "London-nytts landsutgave", "Fri presse", "Rex 
rotary", "SS-opposisjonen", and was engaged in other illegal activities

passed their copy to others, thus a total of ca. 800 people regularly 
received the news. In February 1943 the member Stenersen was arrested, 
betrayed by an informer. He was deported to the camp Natzweiler and 
later to Dachau, where he died prior to the liberation. Adrian 
Pettersen and Einar Ravnboe were deported to Germany, survived and 
returned to Norway after the war

distributed by "Dansk samling", and was the biggest illegal daily in 
Denmark. In February 1945 the printing house was seized by the Gestapo 
and 20 co-workers were arrested. Still, the paper published as planned 
the next day, was duplicated, and for the following 28 days it was 
published this way. A printing house was taken from the Germans, and 
the paper continued to be printed until the capitulation. The articles 
were written by the paper's own co-workers, they also received news 
from "Information", connections within the legal press and form the 
paper's own correspondents across the country. Furthermore, the paper 
contained articles from Danish and Norwegian, illegal papers as well as 
foreign papers and magazines.

of "Mutations". The action followed the publication, in that day's 
edition of the magazine, of an article entitled "Un ancien putschiste 
seme la Etoudi" ("A former putschiste sows panic in Etoudi"). The 
article alleged that Captain Guerandi Mbara, one of the instigators of 
a failed coup in 1984, wanted to seize power again. The confiscation of 
"Mutations" is only the latest in a long series, says RSF. Even though 
the 24 June ban order against "Mutations", introduced by the minister 
in charge of territorial administration, was lifted on 4 July, seizures 
of the magazine have continued on a regular basis

*505  $aOn 26 January 1995, the monthly "Tri Thuc Va Cong Nghe", published by a metal and iron industries association in Vietnam, was suspended until further notice by the Minister of Culture and Information for "modifying the presentation of its cover and publishing articles which do not conform to its principles and readership". On 21 January, the Minister of Culture and Information "temporarily" suspended "Ngui Ha Noi" (The Hanoian), the weekly publication of the Art and Literature Association of Hanoi, for "violating the press law" by publishing an article "hostile" to the government's decision to outlaw fireworks as of 1 January this year. In the directive suspending publication, the culture ministry ordered the paper to draw up a "self-criticism" admitting the responsibility of its editor and that of other staff members

local editorial office was established in Fyn and they started 
co-operating with the paper "Frisk mod". The paper was shut down from 
September 1944 to January 1945, as several of the co-workers were 
arrested. One of the arrested, Peter de Hemmer Gudme, committed suicide 
as he otherwise would have been forced to reveal the names of his 
comrades. In the spring of 1945 the paper was distributed together with 
"S.E" og "Nyt fra Norden" and a news service: "Aktuel orientering".

*520  $aThe nearly twenty essays in this volume deal with obscenity in medieval culture. They represent the most wide-ranging attempt ever to probe the natures, origins, and consequences of obscenity in medieval literature, art, theatre, and law. Although a core is devoted to obscenity in medieval French literature (where the fabliaux have elicited more previous attempts to come to terms with  obscenity than has any other type of medieval literature),other contributions to the volume explore manifestations of obscenity in cultures and languages of Scandinavia, Germany, Ireland, Wales, Byzantium, and even western Slavdom

*505  $aIran's Media Monitoring Committee banned the radical weekly 
"Payam-e-Daneshjoue" for "repeated infringements of the press law". The 
charge is thought to stem from clauses in the law forbidding the 
publication of material which "violates the rules of Islam and the 
foundations of the Islamic Republic,... encourages antagonism between 
social classes... [and] insults officials, institutions, organisations 
and individuals." However, no official notification of the ban was sent
