*505  $aSeyrius Cephus, the lawyer for "The Independent", said the paper was to appear on the newsstand on 29 March since the court has mandated that "The Independent" return to its previous position as a free agent to do its business. However, the paper did not appear on the newsstands as expected because the government of Liberia has maintained its ban on the newspaper and has instructed printing houses not to print it. The government, through the Justice Ministry, has described as "misinterpretation" reports that the ban on the paper had been lifted. The Supreme Court will hear the case in full on 4 April 2004.

*505  $aIn a 24 July 2007 decision, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has condemned Turkey for "limiting freedom of expression", when the "Yedinci Gündem" newspaper was banned in the Emergency Law (OHAL) Regions by the regional governor. In its 24 July decision, the ECHR decided unanimously that interference with the newspaper's activities was "unnecessary in a democratic society" and in violation of Article 10. The newspaper, which was first published on 23 June, was banned from the OHAL regions four days later. When legal appeals were fruitless, its 10 employees applied to the ECHR.

"Al-Rai Al-Shaab" columnist Kamal Omer reported that on 21 August the security services conditioned the newspaper's publication on the withdrawal of several articles. When the editorial staff refused to comply, the entire issue was again seized, at a heavy financial loss for the newspaper. Since then, it has not been able to publish.

The publication and distribution in Gabon of the newspaper was banned until its status is "regularised." The reason is reportedly the fact that the newspaper's last issue was printed and distributed in Gabon even though the newspaper had allegedly never established itself as a Gabonese press outlet. On 25 September, issue number 78 of the Gabonese edition of "Le Gri-Gri International," which was to appear on 27 September, was censured "because of its content" by VDP printers, thereby preventing the distribution of this issue in Gabon. The newspaper's front page referred to the announcement, a few days earlier, by President Omar Bongo (nicknamed "Mullah Omar") of the imminent development of the iron mines in Belinga, located in the north-eastern province of Ougooué-Ivindo, describing it as a "Gabonese deception." The newspaper also expressed concern about pollution and ecosystem destruction at the local and national level as a result of this development.

The story is about the business dealings of former first lady Marta Sahagún - Vicente Fox's wife - and her sons with a Guanajuato-based businessman. Most copies of the magazine, normally sold in newspaper kiosks and in big chain stores like Sanborn's, Mega Comercial, Wal-Mart and Vips, were bought up by a few individuals who asked for all available copies. Fox's family is presently under investigation for illicitly-gained income and influence peddling.

Information Minister said the magazine featured an article by Dr. Lao Monghai which challenged former king Norodom Sihanouk's immunity from being called as a witness or tried at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), established to secure justice for victims of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime that reigned from 1975 to 1979. The minister said the article is against the constitution, which states that the King "shall be inviolable".

*505  $aThe Commission for Press Authorisation and Surveillance decided on 28 January 2008 to suspend the feminist monthly "Zanan" ("Women" in Farsi) for "publishing information detrimental to society's psychological tranquillity." The commission accused "Zanan" of "offering a sombre picture of the Islamic Republic," "compromising its readers' mental health" and "publishing morally questionable information." Dozens of news outlets have been suspended by the commission since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president. Deputy state prosecutor Nasser Saraji told the official news agency ISNA in October 2007 that the commission had suspended 42 publications and cancelled 24 licences since 2005. Other newspapers have been temporarily or provisionally suspended by the courts. Those suspended since October include "Krafto", "Ashati", "Arzesh", "Bilmaj" and "Madareseh". ??

Abbasbeyli speculated that the newspapers were confiscated in Sabirabad due to critical articles in the newspaper about social conditions in the region and illegal activities of the local officials.
