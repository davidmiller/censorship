*505  $aCould no longer be printed in Egypt. Like several other 
publications, the English-language "Cairo Times" has been printing in 
the free investment zone established in Nasser City, which is the only 
place where it may print in Egypt due to the fact that it is licensed 
abroad - a measure adopted by the magazine in order to circumvent 
government restrictions on printing licences. The apparent 
justification for the printing ban on "Cairo Times" is that authorities 
consider the magazine a "political" publication, and hence not able to 
publish in the zone according to current regulations

*505  $aShut down and suspended by the Istanbul State Security Court
*505  $aOn 9 April 1996, Istanbul State Security Court ordered the 
leftist daily "Evrensel" shut down for one month for having published 
two articles on 30 August 1995. The first one, entitled "Special Forces 
Execution in Midyat", was ruled to have incised racism, which is in 
violation of Article 312 of the Penal Code. The second one, "Efforts to 
mediate between iraqi kurdish groups", was deemed a violation of 
Article 6 of the Anti-terror Law banning the publication of "statements 
by terror organizations". On 4 April, "Evrensel" was ordered shut down 
for one month for "inciting hatred" and "promoting racism" in a 
September 1995 column about World peace today. The column called for an 
end to the fighting between the Turkish army and Kurdish rebels. So 
far, the newspaper has been confiscated 23 times, while there are 26 
trials continuing against it. "By applying the highest possible 
punishment under the law, the court's decision proves to be a part of 
the harassment scheme," the statements said
*505  $aOn 18 April 1996, Istanbul State Security Court ordered the 
leftist daily "Evrensel" closed for ten days for publishing the 
statement of a terrorist organization, a violation of Article 7 of the 
Anti-Terror Law. The charge stems from an article published in the 
paper on 29 October 1995 about the Revolutionary Front of the People's 
Liberation Party (DHKPC)
*505  $aOn May 9, an Istanbul State Security Court ordered the leftist 
daily "Evrensel" closed for twenty days for publishing an article, 
entitled "Confessions of a military officer", that allegedly incited 
racism, a violation of Article 312 of the Penal Code.

*520  $aMike Godwin is a twenty-first-century crusader for free speech. 
As online counsel to theElectronic Frontier Foundation, Godwin is often 
the one who gets the first panicked calls fromInternet bulletin board 
operators or private citizens when their apartments are searched 
andcomputers seized. Deeply involved in civil liberties on the Net, 
Godwin shares his personalexperience as a lawyer in the fight against 
the controversial Communications Decency Act of 1996.He provides expert 
analysis of the disturbing case of Jake Baker, whose short stories 
aboutrape-torture, published in an internet newsgroup, resulted in the 
seizure of his dorm-room computer.Godwin also brings new insight to the 
Church of Scientology's claims of intellectual property andcopyright

*505  $aBefore publishing this paper, the news group functioned as a 
large distribution central for illegal newspapers and sold a great 
amount of illegal books from the publishing house Frit Nordisk Forlag. 
The paper ceased publication owing to a raid by Gestapo where two 
co-workers were arrested. They were interned in a Danish camp until the 
capitulation. 3 co-workers fled to Sweden, and 5 had to go underground. 
The paper managed to publish again in April 1945, and made two issues 
thereafter

issues. Not all issues were distributed

*520  $aThe right to free speech is invoked to protect an astonishing 
range of activities, a range thatseems to expand every day. Newspapers 
publish the names of rape victims, flags are burned,pornography 
flourishes, and all of these controversial actions are protected under 
the constitutionalright of free speech. The Supreme Court increasingly 
decides disputes by invoking the FirstAmendment. Civil libertarians, 
former antiwar protesters, and tobacco advertisers join 
revisionistconservatives in attacking almost all forms of censorship, 
extending the search to the farthestreaches of commercial and symbolic 
speech. In short, we are in the midst of a revolution ofabsolutist 
interpretations of free expression. The absolutists are misguided, 
argues Cass Sunstein.Our government now protects speech that causes 
harm yet forbids speech that is essential, he says.Instead, we should 
conceive of free speech first and foremost as a means to achieve 
civicdeliberation and true popular sovereignty. Building on James 
Madison, Sunstein proposes a "NewDeal" for the first Amendment, a new 
interpretation that attacks undifferentiated absolutism andreplaces it 
with a vision of responsible public life. Sunstein examines 
broadcasting, campaignfinance, hate speech, pornography, government art 
funding, commercial speech, and the privacy ofrape victims. He insists 
that political speech, essential for the functioning of any democracy, 
mustnot only be protected, but encouraged. If the government, say were 
to use broadcasting markets toencourage attention to public issues and 
diverse points of view, the First Amendment would notstand in the way. 
Nonpolitical speech, on the other hand, should be less fully protected 
when itconflicts with other interests and rights such as that of 
privacy. Democracy cannot achieve its fullpotential with a stunted 
public discourse. Instant polls and 900 numbers may seem to 
increasepolitical participation, but they are no substitute for 
reasoned and careful public deliberation. InDemocracy and the Problem 
of Free Speech, Cass Sunstein points the way toward a renewal 
ofAmerican democracy and a reaffirmation of political equality.

*505  $a"Denge-Azadi" and "Kurtulus", were informed by the authorities 
that they could not publish because they are successors to publications 
which have been shut down temporarily by courts. If this reasoning is 
applied to all formerly closed publications, journalists who used to 
work for such publications are in effect banned from working in 
publications with similar editorial lines. Article 26 of the Turkish 
Constitution guarantees the right to free expression "alone or 
collectively". The reasoning used to ban the above mentioned 
publications prohibits some writers and reporters from exercising this 
right

paper while living in Jevnaker for a year. On his return to Oslo, he 
stored the printing equipment in a coffin, which he then buried. In 
Oslo he ran yet another illegal paper, as well as being engaged in 
other illegal activities. Arrested in June 1943, he was sent to the 
German concentration camp Dautmergen, where he died in October 1944. On 
the prisonship to Germany he told a friend of the buried printing 
equipment. After the war, the equipment was placed in the War Printing 
Collection in the National Library of Norway
