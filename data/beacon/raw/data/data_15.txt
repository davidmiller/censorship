It covers both preparing for implementation (staffing infrastructure, action planning, records management and training) and actual implementation (use of ICT, logging systems and handling requests). This book also includes an examination of how FOI links with other legislation such as data protection and human rights."

The 8 to 14 February 2004 issue examined the role of the army in Algeria's recent history. The magazine's management said it was given no explanation as to why the issue was not distributed. Issue 2248 of "Jeune Afrique-l'intelligent" magazine appears to have been held back by the Communications and Culture Ministry's press section, which is responsible for authorising the distribution of foreign publications.

Alvarez is accused of murder but his case was dismissed on a legal technicality. The ruling, on the request of Alvarez's brother, who is an attorney, covers "articles, commentaries, signed or unsigned, whatever the circumstance, relating to the acts that were investigated" in the criminal case, whose details captured the attention of the local community. Some government officials in Salta have called for a new investigation.

*505  $aThe independent weekly newspaper "Den" faced the threat of eviction from Grodno, a city near the Polish border, just days after police seized the newspaper's entire print run. Mikolai Markevich, former editor-in-chief of the newspaper "Pagonya", shut down in 2001, took over "Den" after serving 18 months of hard labour for insulting President Alexander Lukashenko. The harassment of "Den" had gone on for several months. The paper faced repeated obstruction to its publication, from abrupt confiscations to the refusal of local printing companies to work with the newspaper, forcing its publishers to move the printing to neighbouring Russia. Police seized 4,800 copies of "Den" in the town of Ivye, approximately 130 kilometres from Grodno. The copies were being transported to Belarus from the printers in Smolensk, Russia. No reason was given for the seizure and the copies remained in the police's possession. The seized issue carried an article criticising the police's refusal to take action against two men who were arrested on 18 March while attempting to break into the offices of Batskaushchyna, the organisation that hosts the "Den" team. Markevich recognised one of the men as a KGB officer.

*505  $aThe Belarus postal service, Belpochta, which delivers newspapers to subscribers country-wide, and state distributor Belsayuzdruk both cancelled their 2004 contracts with the newspaper 'Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta'. In addition, Irina Makovetskaya, the paper's correspondent in Gomel, southern Belarus, received several death threats in anonymous telephone calls during the night of 10 to 11 January. In a 28 December letter, Belpochta said it would not renew its contract with "Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta" on the grounds that the paper was only published sporadically in 2003. In fact, the authorities suspended "Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta" for three months in May over an article deemed offensive to President Lukashenko (see IFEX alerts of 26 and 2 June and 30 May 2003). The paper subsequently encountered difficulties in resuming publication. "Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta" has been printed in Smolensk, Russia, since September. The Belarusian state distributor Belsayuzdruk, which has a virtual monopoly, has refused to distribute the paper in Minsk, Brest and Vitsebsk since 9 January.

The eighth and final issue of the magazine, published in June 2003, included a report on a meeting between the United Nationalities Alliance and United Nations special envoy to Burma Razali Ismail. After the issue appeared, the Military Intelligence Service threatened editor-in-chief Sai Nood with prosecution if he continued to publish "Hsenpai". 
The magazine's seventh issue, published in March 2003, had announced that future issues of "Hsenpai" would include political news. Sai Nood was imprisoned from February to May 2003.

The article, written by "Jeune Afrique L'Intelligent" staff writer Cheick Yerim Seck, referred to measures which it claimed President Lansana Conté used to persuade François Lonceny Fall to rescind his decision to resign from his position as prime minister.That was the second time in two weeks that an edition of the newspaper had been prevented from going on sale. Issue 2260 of the paper (dated 2 to 8 May) remains in the MATD's possession. The ministry prevented circulation of the previous issue for similar reasons.

The suspension order came only days after publisher Javad Khorami Moaghadam was summoned by Mortazavi, who demanded in vain that Moaghadam fire the paper's editor-in-chief, Emadoldin Baghi, a leading figure of the reformist press and staunch free expression advocate.

Following questioning, Soltani was remanded in custody. He is accused of "disseminating false news" and "disturbing public opinion and public order". On 15 May, his colleague Massud Almassi was arrested on the same grounds. The newspaper has suspended its publication in protest, calling the charges "illegal and arbitrary". The arrests appear to be linked to a story carried by the newspaper about the rape of a four-year-old girl.

On 1 September 2003, Sabti was given a three-month prison sentence with no parole and an additional four-month suspended sentence for publishing an open letter from residents of a Gorgan neighbourhood, protesting a local park's takeover by public authorities. The courts, which were implicated in the case, filed a defamation complaint. Sabti had been on provisional release until the court's sentence.

The suspensions came after the newspapers published portions of an open letter on February 18 from several reformists who had resigned from Parliament. The letter criticized Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, and asked if he was complicit in the decision to bar several reformists from running for parliamentary seats. Iranian authorities consider criticism of Khamenei intolerable, and therefore it rarely appears in Iranian newspapers. The court orders said the suspensions were temporary, but most newspapers in Iran that the Press Court has temporarily banned have not reopened.

A letter signed by CPA administrator L. Paul Bremer was hand-delivered by a CPA spokesman to the paper's staff, saying that the publication had violated a CPA decree promulgated last June that prohibits "incitement" in the media. Specifically, the letter said the paper had published "many articles" containing false information and intended to "disturb public order and incite violence against the coalition forces and the employees of the CPA." CPA spokesman Alaaeddin Elsadr told CPJ that Al-Hawza could appeal the closure decision, however, he did not make clear the procedures for doing so, other than stating that the newspaper could phone him to openly discuss the matter.

On 12 December 2003, the minister warned that a crackdown would be carried out because the owners of the "alternative press" had failed to respect journalistic principles with respect to balance and fairness. Newspapers that were confiscated include the "Independent", "Kenya Confidential", "Citizen", "News Post", "Weekly Wembe" and "Summit". Police also arrested "News Post" publisher Ndirangu Kariuki, but later released him. In the coastal town of Mombasa, police impounded bundles of the Nation Media Group's "The Coast Express" at one news stand.

*505  $aOn 10 January 2004, police raided news stands in major Kenyan towns and confiscated copies of newspapers published by the "alternative press". Scores of vendors were arrested in the well-coordinated crackdown, which Tourism and Information Minister Raphael Tuju said was aimed at getting rid of illegal newspapers. He added that the action was taken because the newspapers had not complied with the law on "registration, execution of a bond and making returns". On 12 December 2003, the minister warned that a crackdown would be carried out because the owners of the "alternative press" had failed to respect journalistic principles with respect to balance and fairness. Newspapers that were confiscated include the "Independent", "Kenya Confidential", "Citizen", "News Post", "Weekly Wembe" and "Summit". Police also arrested "News Post" publisher Ndirangu Kariuki, but later released him. In the coastal town of Mombasa, police impounded bundles of the Nation Media Group's "The Coast Express" at one news stand.

*505  $aA magisterial court in Monrovia, presided over by Judge Joseph Fayiah, has placed an injunction on publication of the privately-owned "New Broom" newspaper. According to MFWA sources in Liberia, a 14 July 2004 letter signed by the court clerk instructed all printing houses in the country not to print "New Broom" because the newspaper's management had failed to appear in court to answer to contempt charges.  Managing editor Roland Worwee and "New Broom" staff were served with a writ of summons to appear in court on 11 June 2004 to answer to charges of "criminal malevolence" brought against them by Bureau of Immigration and Naturalisation (BIN) Commissioner Abraham Mitchell. The newspaper's management, however, failed to respond to the summons. The BIN commissioner's suit followed a publication in the "New Broom" in which he was alleged to have received a bribe from the Sierra Leonean ambassador to Liberia, Patrick Foyah, for the release of a number of Sierra Leonean nationals who had been detained for breaking Liberia's immigration laws. Mitchell denied the allegation and gave a three-day ultimatum for the newspaper to retract the story and issue an apology. He took legal action when the paper failed to comply.

Chiumia is president of the New Dawn for Africa (NDA) political party and Mtumodzi is the NDA's secretary-general. The NDA supports the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) party and is widely believed to be funded by UDF supporters. According to Lusungu Mhango, production manager of the Karora printing and publishing company, Chiumia and Mtumodzi went to his printing press to print their own newspaper, "The Informer". When they arrived, they became angry after discovering that "The Dispatch" newspaper was being printed.

The sentence was severe -- four years in prison (later reduced to three) and a fine of 20,000 Moroccan dirhams (approximately US$2,300). The court imposed the even more extreme punishment of ordering Ali Lmrabet's two weekly papers to be closed. King Muhammad VI pardoned journalist Ali Lmrabet in February 2004.

*505  $aThe Pakistani government's Ministry of Information has effectively banned the publication of all official advertisements in the independent, Urdu-language daily "Jinnah", which began publishing in the capital, Islamabad, on 22 October 2003. The newspaper believes that the step was taken in retaliation for its independent editorial policy. Government advertisements constitute a vital source of revenue for newspapers, and successive governments, including the present one, have pledged not to use advertisements as a tool to punish or reward media outlets. The circulation figures of publications are audited by the official Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC). Publications are then issued ABC certificates and placed on the Central Media List. "Jinnah" went through this process and was placed on the Central Media List on 6 December. However, on 9 July 2004, the daily was abruptly removed from the Central Media List, depriving it of access to official advertisements.

*505  $aJournalist Sihem Bensedrine failed in her attempt to register the weekly newspaper "Kalima". Bensedrine was turned away when she tried to begin the registration process for the bilingual publication at the Interior Ministry's offices on 13 January 2004. This is the third time since 1999 that Bensedrine has attempted to file a "preliminary statement" for "Kalima" with the Interior Ministry. A home-produced version of the newspaper is currently published on an irregular basis and distributed unofficially.

*505  $aOn February 5, 2004, after the Monitor published an article about an ongoing inquiry into so-called ghost soldiers in the national army-or names on the army's personnel lists that do not correspond to real soldiers even though salaries are being drawn for them-the government obtained a High Court injunction stopping The Monitor from publishing any other details about the investigation. The injunction was granted based on authorities' claims that the details of the inquiry are "of a highly sensitive and classified security nature," according to The Monitor.

*505  $aIn January 2004, the Shevchenkivskyy District Court ordered the closure of the opposition daily "Silski Visti", which is based in the capital, Kyiv, allegedly for publishing two advertisements in September 2003 for a book that was widely considered anti-Semitic. Local and international reports, however, suggest that the issue of anti-Semitism was used as a pretext to close "Silski Visti", which was widely read, critical of the government, and supportive of the opposition Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU), in an election year.

*505  $aThe government-controlled Media and Information Commission (MIC) decided on 10 June 2004 to suspend the private weekly "The Tribune" for one year. "The Tribune" is the second newspaper to be shuttered under Zimbabwe's repressive Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA). According to sources in Harare, on 10 June, the MIC chairman, Tafataona Mahoso, said in a press statement that "The Tribune" would be closed for one year. The statement claimed that African Tribune Newspapers (ATN), the company that publishes "The Tribune", had violated Section 67 of AIPPA by failing to notify the commission of changes in ownership, name, and frequency of publication. The statement also alleged that the newspaper had employed an unaccredited  journalist. Under the AIPPA, all journalists must be accredited by the MIC to work. Ownership of "The Tribune" changed hands in March, when the newspaper's current management bought out the former owners. Publication frequency also changed in January when ATN merged its two weekly publications into one newspaper.

*520  $aDescription: The current situation in Zimbabwe under the ZANU-PF government shows increasing signs of abuse of power by those in political control. They also direct their desire to suppress criticism towards the media. Press organs in private ownership have been closed down and journalists have been physically harassed, arrested and expelled. Laws are abused to regulate and manipulate public opinion by a policy of banning. Worldwide condemnation of the growing restrictions upon the freedom of expression goes hand in hand with the protests inside the country against the growing tendencies of totalitarian rule. Current events are critically reflected upon and the background to these developments is summarised in this publication. It is based on some of the contributions to a recent conference on Zimbabwe organised by the Nordic Africa Institute and offers insights into the contested space of public opinion in Zimbabwe. The critical analyses of current developments are there-by complemented with particular reference to the media sector in the ongoing battle for hegemonic control over the public sphere.
