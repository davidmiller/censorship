*520  $aConflict is the essence of civil liberty. Individual or group 
rights are rarely, if ever, willingly bestowed without a struggle. From 
the day that King John was forced at Runnymede to recognize that his 
barons had certain prerogatives to the present era, when racial 
minorities, women, and gays and lesbians fight for a place at the table, 
the din of political, judicial, and sometimes violent battle echoes 
through the United States. And yet, are the law of freedom of speech 
and the law of equality truly on a collision course? Henry Louis Gates, 
Jr., has written that the strongest argument for regulating speech is 
the unreflective stupidity of most of the arguments for the other side 
- the tendency of those "who invoke the First Amendment mantra, and seem 
immediately to fall into a trance, oblivious to further argument and 
evidence." In an attempt to move past such rote recitations, this 
volume brings together such thinkers as Sylvia Law, Martin Redish, Ira 
Glasser, Randall Kennedy, Susan Deller Ross, and Wendy Kaminer to engage 
in a free-ranging conversation about this very issue. Focusing on the 
flashpoint topics of abortion clinic violence, workplace harassment, and 
hate crimes/hate speech, the contributors illustrate ways that we might 
get beyond there flexivity that has dictated much of the debate around 
speech and equality.

who printed the paper illegally at their school. Subsequently they fled 
to Sweden. Shortly after their escape, the school was raided by the 
Nazi state police. No evidence was found, although the students had hid 
some manuscripts and copies of the paper in the loft. New publishers 
ensured continued publication. In April 1942 the member Joar Markali 
was arrested, presumably betrayed by an informer, and was severly 
tortured. A year later he was sent to Sachsenhausen. Another member, 
Bjoern Reinertsen, was killed in a shoot-out with the Nazis. The member 
Nesbold escaped to Sweden

*505  $aSuspended by Minister of Communication
*505  $aThe government evening paper "Horizons" was suspended on 30 May 
1995 by the Minister of Communications for "crossing the line of 
conduct of the State". On 7 June, the Minister of Communication 
suspended three papers: the daily "El Ouma" and the weeklies "La 
Nation" and "El-Hourriya". The three papers published an appeal 
co-signed by the Front Islamique dy Salut (FIS) and eight political 
parties in favour of a "people's assembly". The Minister of 
Communication justified this suspension because of the inclusion of a 
signature of a "legally dissolved political party ... which is a threat 
to order and public security". "El Ouma" was suspended for fifteen 
days, "La Nation" and "El-Hourriya" for one month. "La Nation" was 
already suspended at the beginning of this year.
*506  $eSuspended for political reasons
*505  $aSuspended, January 31 ("La Nation") "until further notice" ; 
May 30, 1995 ("Horizons") ; June 7, 1995 ("El Ouma ; "El-Hourriya"). - No 
date given for a censorship lift

following the refusal of a public printing press, the Societe

for the printing press's action, it seems to be linked to the 
publication of "security-related" information. Previously, on 25 April,

*520  $aFreedom of information is a broad-ranging concept, covering 
both free access of information and free expression. Perhaps the most 
fundamental freedom, in the sense that all the others hinge upon it, is 
open government, which is only possible within a democracy, 
and usually goes hand-in-hand with freedom of information legislation. 
This topical, controversial and lively collection of papers considers 
freedom of information issues in those states currently in the nebulous 
phase of changing to a democratic form of government from a 
non-democratic one. Drawn from the recent IGLA Conference of the same 
name. The papers look at a wide range of topics including writers and 
governments, the abuse of human rights, democracy and Islam, freedom 
of information in South Africa, and libraries and access to information. 
With an impressive line-up of contributors the articles explore the 
implications for democracy in the world and the future of the concept of 
freedom of information. The papers are divided into three broad 
geographical areas: the Far East the ex-Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 
and Africa, but the subject is universal.

*505  $aPublished by a "D.K.P."-group in Esbjerg. In April 1943 one 
group member was arrested by Danish police and sentenced to six months 
in prison. In June another member was arrested, sentenced to three 
weeks in prison. In September, October and November 1943, 26 group 
members were arrested by the Gestapo, of which 8 were sentenced to a 
German prison, and another 8 were deported to German concentration 
camps. Four were released and several group members went underground. 
The group was reorganised and the paper published regularly every month 
until October 1944, when new arrests were made. The paper published 
again in December 1944, but a Gestapo raid in January 1945, more group 
members were arrested. The group succeeded in publishing again in 
February, and published every month until the capitulation. One of the 
editors, Aksel E. Andersen, was arrested in October 1943 and tortured. 
As he revealed nothing, he was murdered on the 4th of December 1943 by 
the Gestapo along with two other resistance people. Another group 
member, Peder M. Nielsen, died in a German prison 3 October 1944.

on the grounds that they are not formally registered. The affected 
newspapers reportedly include: "The Express", "The New Pioneer", "The 
Rolyc", "The Independent Observer", "The New Times", "The Morning 
Post", "The Watch", "The Triumph", "The Financial Times", "The 
Reporter" and "The Nation". According to Article 19, no newspapers are 
currently registered, and therefore the imposition of this ban appears 
to be discriminatory, based upon the editorial content of the affected 
papers

*505  $aThe paper "Fantomet" was started in October 1942 at the time 
of, and probably as a response to, the introduction of the death 
penalty for publishing illegal newspapers. Some papers chose to 
discontinue publishing for a period, while others published without 
names. The group behind "Fantomet" had a member, Arent U. Greve, who 
for some time worked as an interpreter for the Germans, and therefore 
had obtained a radio. 57 issues were published, of which 30 are kept in 
the Public Record Office. Leif W. Stene was arrested for distributing 
the paper, and was due for deportation to Germany, when his family was 
bombed and he was released

*505  $aPublishing began early in 1941. The publisher was Henrik Weber, 
who initially published weekly surveys. The paper was printed in a 
secret room in Sigurd Hebers summer residence, which was raided by the 
Gestapo in April 1943. No trace of the paper was found. Gunnar Eide, 
who was in charge of distribution, had to flee to Sweden in February 
1944, barely escaping the Gestapo. The last issue was published on May 
24, 1944, as several distributors were arrested. Sigurd Hebern arrived in 
safety to Sweden

Communist Party in Bergen. The paper was initiated by Erling Joerstad, 
who later was arrested and deported to a German prison camp, where he 
died. The paper also aimed to warn Norwegian youths against the Nazi 
authorities attempts to forcibly enroll youth to the labour force, as 
well as spreading information to the already enrolled. The group also 
published leaflets in German distributed to the German soldiers, urging 
them to desert, and published the paper "Radio Nytt" with the subtitle 
"Fortroppens nyhetsavis". The Germans discovered the printing works and 
arrested several of the members. Willy Valentinsen was shot in the 
street by the Nazis

*24500$a1997 Congressional Committee, supported by the Nixon White 
House, sought to establish control over broadcast news by investigating 
editorial news judgement. 
*505  $aFrank Stanton, legendary President of CBS, refused to produce 
outtakes from the award-winning documentary, "The Selling of the 
Pentagon," subpoenaed by the Committee in an attempt to condemn the 
program and CBS. The Committee voted to hold Stanton and CBS in 
contempt, and the House of Representatives held a full debate on its 
power to investigate and control broadcast news. Had Stanton not taken 
up the fight he describes to gain First Amendment protection, broadcast 
news would have been shaped by Congressional hearings and intimidation. 
Finally Stanton's story is told in his own words in this account of his 
fight to secure First Amendment freedom for the news media. This book 
examines the ongoing conflict between media and government and dismisses 
the theory that press regulation by a government agency is desirable. 
CBS's fight over "The Selling of the Pentagon" clearly illustrates how 
government interference can keep vital information from the public. 
Broadcast news history shows that press regulations are not benign - 
despite government claims - and once they are in place, neither great 
resources nor the urgent need for truth may fully remove them. As public 
opinion polls show increasing support for such regulations, Stanton's 
story serves as a timely reminder of the need for a press free 
ofg overnment interference, as print, cable, broadcast, and satellite 
news move onto the Information Superhighway.

1941, then with no title. The title first appeared in nr. 25, dated 
July 26 1941. The paper soon became an important contact and 
information instrument in the resistance struggle. 18000 copies were 
printed in January 1942, when the Gestapo arrested several members, 
amongst them Kaare Haugen and Per Lie. Both suffered heavy torture and 
were deported to German concentration camps. Per Lie died in the spring 
of 1945 in Dachau. Kaare Haugen survived. Oddvar Halvorsen served as 
editor until his escape to Sweden in the autumn of 1943. In spite of 
the arrests, the paper succeeded, thanks to new volunteers. When Peder 
Soeiland was arrested, he was succeeded by Hans G. Lund. He was killed, 
and succeeded by Thorvald Karlsen and Egil Larsen. Henry Wahlen and 
Adolf Sandbo were sent on the prisoner ship Westphalen, Wahlen died 
when the ship sank, Sandbo was one of five survivors. Many escaped to 
Sweden. A total of 122 of the group were arrested, of these many were 
deported to German concentration camps. 19 lost their lives

*505  $aThe paper was published by politically independent people from 
the resistance movement. With vol. 1 no. 9 the paper collaborated with 
the news group 29 August, and from no. 12 the two editorial offices 
merged and the paper 29 August ceased to publish. In May 1944 the 
printing house was subject to a raid by the Gestapo, and 52.000 copies 
were seized. But the paper published regularly again from the July 
issue. The group was harassed by the Gestapo on many occasions, 
consequently resulting in the arrest of several group members, while 
others had to go underground in the spring of 1944. Three co-workers 
died: Preben Larsen was arrested in May 1944 and deported to Germany to 
Neuengamme where he died. Carl Alfred Nielsen, who was one of the 
founders, was killed by the Germans in 1945 in Hvidovre. Viggo 
Wedel-Brandt was arrested at one of the printing houses, deported and 
died in a German concentration camp

*505  $aThe paper started publishing on 9 April 1942, exactly two years after the German invasion. It was published by a group of Danes with strongly different political views, but who all united in the struggle for a free Denmark. The people in charge simultaneously organised a number of groups across the country, who partly duplicated, partly printed the paper. The circulation increased every month, and in Nov. 1944 Frit Danmark included 15-20 professional groups in Copenhagen and 80-100 local groups in the provinces, that together distributed the paper in 114.000 copies. At the end of the occupation the paper distributed 145.000 copies, in addition to it being duplicated and printed by many other news groups. Most issues were printed in the groups' own illegal printing houses, which were established in Copenhagen and in the provinces. The group also published many illegal books and plays, posters and pamphlets. In Nov./Dec. 1942 Danish police arrested 5 members, and later the Free Denmark-groups were subject to countless raids by the Gestapo. This did not influence their distribution of the paper, who published regularly throughout the occupation period

*505  $aThe story of "Fronten" serves as a model example of the 
importance of an illegally published paper as part of a joint, well 
organised resistance struggle in a medium-sized Norwegian town. Fronten 
was established by central resistance people in Notodden. However, it 
soon became necessary to divide the activities of armed resistance and 
that of publishing, and the resistance activist Kai Knutsen, later to 
become minister of justice and defence in the civil government of 
liberated Norway, took charge of the paper. The last issue was 
published the day after the liberation

*505  $aIn neutral Sweden, a news group was formed by prominent 
politicians and intellectuals strongly engaged in the Norwegian 
struggle for freedom. Several Norwegian refugees, along with the German 
refugee Willy Brandt, joined the group in producing the paper with the 
Norwegian writer Torolf Elster as editor. He had to flee, as he participated in publishing two illegal papers known to the Gestapo. 
Haandslag played an important role in the resistance movement, not 
least thanks to it's eminent Norwegian artist and cartoonist Ragnvald 
Blix. The main distributor in Oslo, Adolf Wichstroem was arrested in 
June 1943 and deported to the German camp Natzwailer. He died later in 
the camp of Dautmergen. The paper published 65 issues

to a large "F.D."-group. In March 1944 the news group was exposed to 
searches, and one member was arrested and interned until 22 February 
1945. Another member was arrested in the autumn of 1944 and remained

*505  $aIn September 1941, a large number of illegal papers were 
started in Oslo, amongst them "Halv aatte", which was published by two 
students, Bjoern Bie and Ola Bonnevie. Both were engaged in the group 
behind the publishing of "Liberty bell", "Hugin-Munin" and "Mens vi 
venter". Bjoern Bie was arrested in December 1941, but publishing 
continued. 80 issues had been published when 4 members were arrested in 
May/June 1942. Imprisoned in the Norwegian prison camp Grini, they made 
the last issue here and then smuggled it out
