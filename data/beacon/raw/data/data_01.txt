*505  $aNote: On 30 September 1993 the Istanbul State Security Court 
ruled to suspend the publication of the monthly magazine "Newroz" 
magazine for a month for publishing articles that were deemed as 
separatist propaganda. The editor-in-chief, Dogan Karakuzu, was 
sentenced to six months in prison and a fine of 50 million Turkish lira 
(approx. USD 5,000). This is only one of the many cases pursued against 
the magazine in court. There are 24 cases against "Newroz" currently 
being tried, and eight others have already been concluded. All but two 
issues of the publication have been subject to prosecution. The 
magazine reports that its staff has also been under constant harassment 
by the security forces.

*505  $aNote: 18 February 1994 the security court of Istanbul sentenced 
Yasar Kaya, owner of the pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur Gundem to four years 
inprisonment and a fine of 572 million pounds (US
$30,000) and Davut Karadag, former editor-in-chief a fine of 431 
million Turkish pounds (22,600 dollars). Ozgur Gundem was banned once 
again from publication for a month. Yasar Kaya and Davut Karadag were 
convicted for having published articles on the Kurdish question which 
appeared in the 27 April 1993 issues of Ozgur Gundem and were judged to 
be "inimical to national security". The judgements were based on 
Article 8 of the Turkish anti-terrorist legislation which represses all 
"separatist propaganda".  At the same time, and for the same reasons, 
the daily Ozgur Gundem was prohibited from publishing for one month. 
This is the the fourth edict of this kind since 19 November 1993 which 
represents four months of closure. The Turkish Supreme Court approved 
14 April 1994 a lower court's closure decision and ordered the 
pro-Kurdish daily "Ozgur Gundem" to cease publication for 15 days. The 
approval was the first among a series of closure decisions given 
against "Ozgur Gundem", all being appealed to the Supreme Court. The 
newspaper's editors expect the rest of the decisions to be approved as 
well in the next few weeks, mounting to an eight-and-a-half-month shut 
down. The editors decided to close the newspaper down permanently. The 
newspaper had started publication in May 1992.

in the cover story which Milliyet directors already knew about. This 
issue was the last one published by a group of 22 journalists who all 
resigned 31st of march to protest the attitude of Mr. Dogan and Mr. 
Uzan. The Milliyet group owner, has first fired 3 journalists 
responsible for the cover story and then ordered the confiscation of 
thousands of copies of the issue on sale. Milliyet's men gave strange 
explanations to the news stands :"There are so many technical faults", 
"There is a juridical problem in one article so we have to act before 
the prosecutor". Mr. Dogan has now his name engraved in the black book 
of Turkish press history as the "first newspaper owner who confiscated

official ministry statement accused the paper of repeatedly publishing 
false and defamatory reports with the intent of undermining the 
security of the state. Essah Afa, a satirical independent weekly, was 
suspended indefinitely by order of the Ministry of the Interior, on 
August 19. An official statement explained that the action stemmed from 
the weekly's persistent publication of the contents of Islamic 
Salvation Front (FIS) communiques. Le Matin, La Nation, and Al Jazair 
al Youm were suspended on August 9. Presidential Decree No. 92 320, 
signed by President Ali Kafi on August 11, was used to justify the 
suspension of all six papers, even though Le Matin, La Nation, and Al 
Jazair al Youm had already been closed when it was issued. The decree 
endows the Ministry of the Interior with the power to suspend or close 
"any company, organ, establishment, or business whose nature or 
activities imperil public order, public security, the normal 
functioning of state institutions, or the higher interests of the 
country."

*505  $aNote: Fodhil and Bouokba, director and columnist of the 
Arabic-language independent weekly Echourouk al-Arabi, were arrested 
and charged with harming national unity and security. The charges stem 
from an article by Bouokba on June 21 in which he criticized Algeria's 
"francophone" regime on the grounds that it discriminates against the 
Arabic-speaking population; he also accused the regime of being the 
servant of the French government. Gendarmes raided the offices of 
Echourouk al-Arabi, in Algiers, and confiscated copies of every issue 
since Mr. Bouokba began writing for the paper. The paper was ordered 
indefinitely suspended. And on July 6, Fodhil and Bouokba were 
convicted and sentenced to four months in prison.

*505  $aNote: The newspaper "Le Patriote", a French-language weekly 
published in Oran, remains banned in Algeria since the first issue came 
out on 4 August 1994. It was banned by the Minister of Justice without 
any official explanation. The police who were in charge of notifying 
the editor of the paper, Abdelmalek Ouasti, of the decision, were 
informed that "Le Patriote" was being published legally. The public 
prosecutor's office and Minister of Communication apparently had both 
given their approval for the paper at the time; and in a letter dated 
12 September 1994, the Minister of Communication denies responsibility 
for the order. The matter therefore seems to have been picked up by the 
Minister of Justice.

censored by Egyptian authorities on October 20. Reportedly the 
authorities did not accept the publication of information about the

Hayat" printed an article by the Lebanese writer Joseph Samaha, who 
wrote that the "Islamic trend has exploited the seism", especially 
since "the state proved its deficiency." The September 8 issue of the 
London-based pan-Arab daily Al-Hayat was banned from distribution in 
Egypt. It contained an article by a Sudanese scholar that critically 
examined Egyptian-Sudanese relations.

*505  $aNote: By recommendation of the Islamic Research Academy of the 
Al-Azhar Religion University, the collected works of FARAG FOUDA, 
writer and editorial writer for "Octobre" who was assassinated on 8 
June 1992 by Muslim extremists, have in effect been banned on 7 January 
1993. The most recent edition of the collected works of Farag Fouda 
were withdrawn from all book stores by the "Organisme General du Livre" 
(O.G.L. - state distribution agency), only three days after 
publication. His books include 'The Absent Truth' which attacked the 
view of a Muslim state. This "banning" comes a few weeks before the 
opening of the Cairo International Book Fair, planned for January 26. 
The 1992 edition of the collection was sold out following the 
withdrawal of 8 other works by order of the Islamic Research Academy of 
the Al-Azhar Religion University. Article 103 of the Egyptian 
Constitution, which sets out the mandate of Al-Azhar, does not give the 
Islamic Research Academy the right to ban or confiscate books, limiting 
its role to having the power to recommend such activities.

unidentified colleagues were arrested. He was accused of "printing a 
cartoon which insulted the founder of the Islamic Republic Imam 
Khomeini." The cartoon depicted a religious figure missing a hand and 
possibly half a leg as a soccer player. On September 16 Arabha was 
convicted of "acting against internal security and insulting the 
exalted Imam Khomeini" and was sentenced to six months in prison by a 
criminal court. Earlier, a colleague from Farad, named Karimzadeh and 
believed to be one of the staffers arrested with Arabha in April, was 
sentenced by an Islamic revolutionary court to one year in prison and a 
500,000 rial fine. The Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance has 
closed the magazine.

*505  $aNote: Well-known Iranian writer Ali-Akbar Saidi Sirjani was 
reported to have died of a 'heart attack' in custody on 27 November 
1994. Sirjani, 63, had been arrested on 14 March 1994 with fellow 
writer Said Niazi Kermani and accused of various charges such as 
espionage, each of which carries the death penalty in Iran. It is 
widely thought that the charges were trumped up and used as a means to 
silence Sirjani who had been very outspoken against the government's 
censorship policies. Seventeen of Sirjani's books had been effectively 
banned by the government. Sirjani's death comes just a few weeks after 
the publication of a declaration by 134 writers in Iran against 
government censorship. On 27 November 1994, the Iranian press agency, 
IRNA, issued a press release announcing that Sirjani had died of a 
"heart attack" under house arrest. Sirjani's family reported that he 
had no history of heart disease before he was imprisoned.

reference to a government edict of 24 March prohibiting independent

He telephoned the president of the "LBS" two minutes into the program 
and demanded that he terminate the broadcast.

authorities. "Le Calame" is published in both French and Arabic 
editions. The magazine was seized by police as it left the state 
printing house. The seizure order was made on 18 May by the Director of 
Public Freedoms on the basis of the pre-publication copies deposited 
with the authorities and relayed to "Le Calame" by telephone. No 
written justification was given for the seizure but the Director of 
Public Freedoms is said to have explained verbally that in his view 
this edition of the newspaper "damaged state security". It appears that 
the seizure is linked to the publication in "Le Calame" of an interview 
with the president of the French non-governmental organisation Agir 
ensemble (Act Together), a Mr Barthelemy, in which he criticizes the 
Mauritanian information service.

*505  $aNote: On 30 and 31 August 1994, no. 117 of the Arab language 
version of "Al-Bayan" and no. 56 of the French "Calame" were 
confiscated in the capital of Nouakchott.  Along with "L'Eveil Hebdo" 
and "La Verite", both of these independent newspapers have been the 
object of numerous seizures. Over the past three months, at least 
twelve confiscations have occurred. "Le Calame", an independent weekly 
newspaper published in French and Arabic, was seized three times in May 
and publication was suspended during June. The 18 May 1994 Arabic 
edition of the newspaper was seized at the printer's after it published 
excerpts from a critical report by two human rights organizations,.The 
newspaper's 23 May French edition was also seized at the printer's. "Le 
Calame" was again silenced on 27 May, when its Arabic edition was 
seized at the printer's for continuing its coverage of the human rights 
abuses and Mr. Ould Dah's role in them, the editor-in-chief said. The 
23 May issue of the weekly independent newspaper "Al Bayane" was seized 
for criticizing the government's censorship of "Le Calame". All the 
seizures were carried out under the orders of the Interior Minister, 
who is in charge of the national press. Although no formal charges have 
been filed against "Le Calame", a 31 May decree issued by Mr. Ould Dah 
suspended publication of the newspaper from June 1 through June 30.

*505  $aNote: The 25 July 1994 edition (no. 136) of the weekly "L'Eveil 
Hebdo" (Awakening) has been seized by the authorities. A document 
notifying the newspaper of the seizure, signed by head of the Bureau of 
Political Affairs and Public Freedoms (Direction des affaires 
politiques et des libertes publiques) of the Ministry of the Interior, 
the Post and Telecommunications, was delivered to the publisher. 
According to this notification, the 25 July edition was seized under 
the provisions of article 11 of the 23 July 1991 law (no. 91.023) 
governing the media. Article 11 stipulates that "the circulation, 
distribution and sale of newspapers or writing, be they in periodical 
form or not, which are prompted by or originate from abroad or attack 
the principles of Islam or the prestige of the state, harm the common 
interest or compromise order and public security, no matter what 
language they are published in, may be banned by order of the Ministry 
of the Interior".

Palestinian police's Preventative Security branch confiscated issues of 
"Al-Nahar" at Erez checkpoint, the border crossing between Israel and 
the Gaza Strip. Some journalists attribute the ban on the paper to a 
perception on the part of Palestinian authorities that "Al-Nahar" does 
not give adequate coverage to official statements of the Palestinian 
National Authority (PNA). 29 July 1994, one day after having banned the 
distribution of the daily newspaper "Al-Nahar" in the Gaza Strip, the 
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) extended the ban to the West Bank.

*505  $aNote: On 28 November 1994, Palestinian police prevented the 
distribution, for approximately six hours, of at least five newspapers 
on that day in the Gaza strip. The newspapers included three 
Arabic-language dailies, "Al Qods", "An Nahar" and "Al Aqsa", the 
Arabic-language weekly "Al Manar", and the Israeli English-language 
daily "Jerusalem Post". The newspapers are believed to have been banned 
because of an "exaggerated" report of the number of people attending an 
Islamic opposition demonstration last Friday 25 November. The 
newspapers were released for distribution on the afternoon of 28 
November. The Ministry of Information of the Palestinian National 
Authority (PNA) subsequently issued a statement that no official order 
had been given to ban the distribution of any newspaper. The Ministry 
blamed the delay on unintentional technical problems and weather 
conditions.

*505  $aNote: Alfred Hermida, the BBC's Tunisian correspondent, was 
expelled on 18 February. Telephone and fax lines of the Kuwaiti press 
agency KUNA were cut, effectively shutting their services down. The 
following day, 19 February, most foreign press representatives were 
summoned one by one and threatened with office closures and withdrawal 
of accreditation if they failed to remain silent, or at least minimize 
their coverage of presidential candidacies. Correspondents from the BBC 
and KUNA have been sanctioned. Some foreign newspaper have been banned 
from sale, including one edition of the Parisian paper "Liberation" and 
the 10 and 18 February editions of the French daily "Le Monde". The 
foreign media has been specifically targeted, since the Tunisian media 
have been utterly silent on the events in question. This can be 
attributed partly to the dvertising monopoly which the Tunisian 
External Communications Agency has enjoyed for the past three years. 
Warnings, directives and bans are common and self-censorship is gaining 
ground. Two reporters for the Tunisian Press Agency (TAP) were 
suspended for three days for sending out foreign reports on Moncef 
Marzouki's candidacy following a "technical error". TAP employees are 
no longer allowed to freely review foreign wires, this task having been 
assigned to "trustworthy" supervisors. A new computer system allows a 
lock on information and surveillance of journalists.

Previously, various editions of the newspaper had been banned from the 
country.  Authorities have also recently refused a television crew from 
the network "France 2" entry into the country in order to cover 
upcoming presidential and legislative elections. A television news 
program broadcast in Tunisia by "France 2" and "TV5 Europe", 
"Geopolis", was not broadcast when it covered the political situation 
in the country.

*505  $aNote: The Parisian daily newspaper "Liberation" was banned on 2 
April 1994. The decision was announced in the official government 
newspaper "La Presse de Tunis" and confirmed the following day by 
Agence tunisienne de communication exterieure (Tunisian Foreign 
Communications Agency - ATCE). According to "La Presse de Tunis", the 
authorities accuse "Liberation" of having "decided to adopt an openly 
hostile attitude towards Tunisia, its leaders and its people". In its 
23 March edition "Liberation" had published an article by a Tunisian 
intellectual which condemned the lack of democracy in Tunisia. This 
issue was not allowed to be sold in Tunisia. "La Presse de Tunis" 
claims that "Liberation" refused three requests for a right of reply 
and rejected for publication a "clarification" by the Tunisian embassy 
in France. According to "Liberation", this "clarification" was no more 
than a series of personal attacks on the author of the article and as 
such was not publishable. The banning of "Liberation" follows the 
banning of several other foreign publications in Tunisia: The French 
daily "Le Monde"; the French monthly "Le Monde diplomatique"; and the 
British daily "The Guardian". As well, many foreign journalists have 
been expelled or declared undesirable.

*505  $aNote: Today, 6 April 1994, the French monthly magazine "Science

related to an article in the March edition of the magazine. In an 
article entitled "L'envers du decor" (The Other Side of Scenery) the 
magazine explored the contradictions between the government's "all-out 
communications strategy" and the reality of human rights and freedom of 
expression in the country. The article also cited Amnesty 
International, whose envoy Donatella Rovera was recently refused entry 
into the country. This banning follows the recent banning of several 
other foreign publications in Tunisia and the expulsion or refusal of 
entry of several foreign correspondents.

According to Drasko Djuranovic, editor-in-chief of the "Monitor", this confiscation, which was carried out by three of the Serbian government's financial inspectors, is just one of many such seizures of the "Monitor" in recent months, copies of which are regularly "intercepted" upon their arrival in Belgrade

*505  $aNote: The ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) has obtained an injunction restraining the "Post" newspaper from any further publication of articles concerning the security of Zambia and the country's stand-off with Angola. Nine "Post" journalists, including editor-in-chief Fred M'membe, were by 22 March all charged with espionage as a result of a lead story which appeared in the newspaper on 9 March. The arrest of the reporters was coupled with a siege of the "Post" editorial offices and its separately located printing press, resulting in a delay of several hours in the printing of the paper. On 10 March, police surrounded the two buildings, prevented anyone from entering or leaving, and also cut the power and water supply. On 11 March, the "Post" failed to appear on the streets of Lusaka as scheduled, the first time this had happened in its seven-year history. Those trapped in the building housing the printing press managed to print the paper, but the police prevented it from being distributed.

The court's decision stemmed from an incident that occurred in February, when two separate versions of the paper were published under the same name, thus violating provisions of the press law. But according to journalists from "Al-Shoura", Yemeni security authorities had helped publish the second version of "Al-Shoura" as a subterfuge.

[material] which is derogatory to national prestige," and stipulated that the magazines would be released only after "blackening the page containing the 'Interview' on Mahatma Gandhi appearing on page 17." "Time"'s circulation in northeast India was disrupted by the move. Subscribers' copies were delivered five days late, and vendors received their shipments several days behind schedule. The Godse interview, meanwhile, was available on "Time" magazine's Web site, and was widely circulated.

The newspaper has been told that the restriction also applies to its Internet edition. "Harakah" is published by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party. This is the latest in a number of repressive actions taken against the newspaper during the past three months, including an order restricting sales to party members only, the confiscation of editions from news-stands and the prosecution of "Harakah"'s editor and printer on sedition charges over an article concerning the trial of jailed ex-Deputy Premier Anwar Ibrahim.

According to a Ministry of Communications statement issued later that day, the action was taken because of an article in that week's issue of "Le Journal" about the continuing dispute over the Western Sahara. The article was written by "Le Journal" director Aboubakr Jamai, based on his recent interview with Muhammad Abdelaziz, leader of the Polisario Front rebel movement, which has been fighting for the territory's independence. The banned edition of "Le Journal" also contained several other articles about the Western Sahara issue. That day's edition of "Al-Sahiffa" did not mention the Abdelaziz interview, but was banned nonetheless.

The order was issued by a National Information Agency (Agence nationale de renseignements, ANR) official. Referring to a published article in the newspaper "L'Alarme", which announced that "Kabila's power will end on 15 December", the ANR official stated that independent newspapers' articles "are increasingly subversive." He warned that "from now on, we will hit back" and noted that he is "paid to protect the regime" in power in Kinshasa.

The issue in question included a report titled "Morocco, the Totalitarian Temptation", which criticised the Moroccan government's 2 December ban on the weeklies "Demain", "Le Journal" and "Assahifa". The article notably denounced "the Moroccan regime's fear of a truly independent press which could open citizens' eyes to an absolute monarchy regime based on a system of feudal power".

*505  $aNote: On 14 December 2000, while conflict in the jails was raging, the Istanbul State Security Court No 4 ordered the media not to broadcast programmes or publish articles that could be an "incitement to crime" and act as "propaganda for illegal organisations". On 20 December, the authorities carried out these threats: five publications in the northern town of Corum, including Dost Haber Gazetesi, were seized for criticising the armed forces' intervention in jails. In the first quarter of 2001, several charges were laid against the far left-wing daily Yeni Evrensel for articles published on 22 and 25 December 2000 denouncing deaths in Turkish jails.

Yet Mohamed Aghnaj, publication director of "Rissalat Al Foutouwa", is in possession of a valid receipt, dated February 1999, authorising him to publish his newspaper. Since November 2000, printers and distributors have refused to print and distribute "Rissalat Al Foutouwa". Aghnaj claims they received "instructions from above." As a result of the pressure, the newspaper's management was forced to find alternative means to print and distribute the newspaper. However, management decided to interrupt publication of "Rissalat Al Foutouwa" as of mid-April.

*505  $aNote: An article on blasphemy published in the 3 September issue of "Newsweek" was censored by the Ministry of Information's press service (PID), which stated that "the article's subject matter is objectionable and may spark violence." The PID added, "the decision has been taken in the public interest" and "the magazine itself has not been banned." On 1 September, a letter was sent to the Customs department instructing them to seize copies of the magazine. The Press Information Department of Karachi (Sindh province in southern Pakistan) ordered Liberty Books Private Limited, "Newsweek"'s distributor in Pakistan, to tear out the controversial article. The article related in detail the death sentence against Younus Sheikh, accused of blasphemy for having taught his students that the prophet Mahomet was not a Muslim until he was forty years old. Liberty Books explained that the magazine would become available once the offending article was suppressed.

*505  $aNote: On 9 March 2000, Salonica judge Maria Robbi banned a best-selling book that was condemned by the Greek Orthodox Church because of passages about the possible sexual longings of Jesus Christ. She justified the ban as a means to prevent ''outbreaks of violence'' after religious zealots threatened to take action against the author and bookstores selling the book. The ban will remain in effect until 16 May, when a hearing is to be held on a suit to permanently halt the sale of ''M to the Power of N'', written by former communist parliament deputy Mimis Androulakis. The ban only applies to Salonica and adjacent prefectures, which are the judge's area of jurisdiction. The book will be available in the rest of Greece. At the same time, additional criminal charges for "blasphemy" have been filed by the Salonica prosecutor's office against the book's author and publisher.

*505  $aNote: The government decided to place the country on a 'war footing' on May 3, which affect the day to day lives of Sri Lankan people in various ways. As if a censorship of news from the conflict zones imposed over 2 years ago (and operational since June 5, 1998) were not enough, the imposition of the most repressive laws ever promulgated in the country has caused the entire democratic process in this country to grind to a halt.

*505  $aNote: The Chinese authorities have recently announced the first "results" of an ideological campaign launched last March against "liberals and rightists". In an interview given on 13 June to the official news agency Xinhua, a director of the State Press and Publications Administration said a new "warning system" had been adopted in order to "help newspapers adhere to the guiding status of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory." This campaign has already led to sanctions against a dozen newspapers and publishing houses. Some of them, including Today China Press, Reform Press and East Wind Press, were closed down. Beijing authorities also banned the publication throughout China of articles written by "liberal scholars", such as Li Shenzhi, He Jiadong and Liu Junning.

The newspaper was ordered closed on 6 August for publishing articles that allegedly defamed officials of Iran's Islamic system. Prior to its shutdown, "Tavana" had published cartoons depicting the president of Iran without his traditional robes and turban. Satire of political leaders is considered by many Shi'ite Moslem clergy to be a taboo.

The court's decision was reportedly based on a new law, adopted on 13 February of this year, which stipulates that a media outlet that loses three lawsuits within twelve months can be shut down. However, this law should not have been applied to "Uch Noqte", which has lost only one case since the new law came into effect.

On 25 November and 1 December, respectively, "Le Journal" and "Assahifa" published a letter credited to former opposition figure Mohamed Basri, which stated that the Moroccan Left was involved in the attempted coup d'etat against King Hassan II in 1972, and directly implicated Youssoufi, the current prime minister and president of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (Union socialiste des forces populaires, USFP, leftist party). Ali Lmrabet, editor of "Demain", stated that he does not understand why his magazine was also banned. "We simply noted the disclosures of 'Le Journal', as many other Moroccan newspapers had, and without publishing any additional information than the others."

Mansour, who is also the president of the Center for Defending Journalists' Freedom, was expelled for life from the Jordanian Journalists' Union for "receiving foreign aid [for his organisation], thus violating Jordanian law". This decision prevents him from ever practicing his profession again because membership to the union is compulsory for journalists. According to the French news agency Agence France Presse, the minister justified his decision by explaining that "the newspaper can no longer be published since there is no editor-in-chief."

*505  $aNote: On 20 December 2000, Kenyan Cabinet Minister Nicholas Biwott was awarded a record KES 30 million (approx. USD 383,000) for libel in a book about the murder of the late Foreign Minister Robert Ouko. The judgement against the British authors of "Dr lain West's Casebook", which implicated the cabinet minister in a 1990 murder case, is the largest award in a libel case in the country's history. The book is banned in Kenya. In a twenty-eight-page judgement, Commissioner Visram prohibited the sale of the book within the court's jurisdiction. The two authors must also pay the costs of the suit. Biwott may enforce the award through the United Kingdom High Court, which would issue a decree forcing West and Stern to pay. The 20 December ruling arose from an earlier suit against the book's publishers, Clays Limited and Little Brown and Company, and two Kenyan bookshops which had sold the book. The case was combined with the one against West and Stern.

*505  $aNote: The closure of Kiyan, a ten-year-old independent journal that specialized in issues of philosophy, religion, and literature, was announced by state-controlled radio and television on January 17. Many of Iran's leading intellectual and artistic figures contributed to the journal during the decade it published. The magazine presented diverse interpretations of Islamic law and promoted open debate on religious and philosophical questions. The summary closure was ordered by Saeed Mortazavi, a judge in Branch 1410 of the Tehran General Court, which deals with press offenses. The order was based on a complaint from Abbasali Alizadeh, the head of the Justice Department in Tehran, in his capacity as general prosecutor. Under Iranian law, only the Press Supervisory Board within the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance can order the closure of newspapers and magazines. The judiciary in this case cited Article 156 (5) of the Constitution, which it claimed empowered it to take appropriate measures in order to prevent crime.

In both cases, the authorities did not give any explanations for the bans. Numerous foreign publications are still banned in Tunisia, including the French newspapers ("Liberation", "Charlie Hebdo", "La Croix", "Le Canard enchaine" and "L'Humanite"), privately-owned Algerian newspapers and certain privately-owned Moroccan newspapers. Moreover, authorised newspapers such as "Le Monde", "Jeune Afrique-L'Intelligent" and "Courrier international" are censored when they deal with the issue of human rights in Tunisia. The press on the Internet is also targeted

The Kuwaiti authorities also refused to renew accreditation of the newspaper's Kuwaiti correspondent, Oulfat Farid, and told the editor-in-chief that she is now banned from visiting the country. A picture of Saddam Hussein and his son Qoussai were on the front page of the last issue of "Al-Tadamon al-Arabi wal-Douali". "Al-Tadamon al-Arabi wal-Douali" is a Cyprus-based fortnightly published and printed in Lebanon. Distributed in a dozen Arab countries, this newspaper is today forbidden in Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Libya.

The minister justified his decision on the fact that "the administrative documents received by the newspaper 'La Libre Afrique' and its supplements 'Le Derby' and 'Incognito' were issued on the basis of false statements made to the administration with regard to the newspaper's and its printer's addresses, as well as the publication director's status as a professional journalist." Moreover, Kikaya added that "'La Libre Afrique' does not fulfil its legal obligation to publish the name or the address of the printer in each copy of the newspaper, which would allow for the verification of the newspaper's administrative and jurisdictional acts."

*505  $aNote: On 22 May 2001, the minister of information banned "The Nation" and "The Guardian" for the second time because "they are prejudicial and/or potentially prejudicial to the interests of the public order in that they are not duly registered and/or are not operating in accordance with the applicable laws of the Kingdom of Swaziland." Previously, on 4 May, the minister had banned the two publications known for their critical tone toward the authorities. But on 18 May, the High Court of Swaziland judged this ban illegal in the case of "The Nation" because the minister gave no reasons for his decision. Attorney General Phesheya Dlamini appealed the High Court's decision. Despite the Court order allowing the magazine to be published, on 22 May, police confiscated the last edition of "The Nation", which is printed in South Africa. The second ban was announced before the High Court could rule on the case of "The Guardian", during a hearing where "The Nation" had appealed for an order banning the police from confiscating the magazine. On 24 May, the High Court ruled that the police action was justified. The High Court will rule on "The Guardian" case soon

*505  $aNote: Namibia's ruling party, the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) has joined the government in an advertising and purchasing ban on "The Namibian" newspaper, because of the newspaper's alleged "hostile attitude" towards government. The government decided in December 2000 to stop advertising in "The Namibian", saying that the newspaper had made "unwarranted criticism" of its policies. In addition, President Sam Nujoma issued an order in late May, forbidding all government departments from buying the newspaper.

Tempo had a circulation of some 180,000 copies when the Suharto government closed it down on June 21, 1994, citing vague "substantive" editorial reasons. Tempo's chief editor Gunawan Mohamad said that until now, the precise reason for the 1994 ban remained unknown, but he speculated that the final blow might have been a report critical of the purchase by the government of 39 old East German navy vessels.

The judges allowed publication of the controversial book five years after the ban's introduction, saying it contains a concise record of Kenya's political, economic and human rights history, and materials from articles published in the local media and from such sources as the Controller, Auditor-General and other government departments, as well as NGOs.

*505  $aNote: Well ahead of the tenth anniversary of the student movement at Tiananmen Square, the government took steps to prevent attempts to commemorate it and to restrict the availability of news about any such events. In April, the Hong Kong-based newspaper "Ming Pao" reported that the Communist Party committee in southern Guangdong province had "banned all articles about the 4 June events and improper use of material taken from the internet". The committee's directive advised newspaper executives to "restrict the number of articles written by commentators", in case their opinions differed from those of the party.

*505  $aNote: On 9 June 1999, the daily and weekly Serbian editions of "Nezavisne Novine", a newspaper which is close to the government of Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, were seized at the border by Serbian police. The next day, copies of the daily edition were seized once again. According to Gradisa Katic, the editor-in-chief of "Nezavisne Novine", "the chief reason [for the seizure] is that our newspaper quotes a number of politicians who stated that the Belgrade regime was going to surrender." The newspaper has often included columns written by Serbian opponents to the regime of Slobodan Milosevic

court banned distribution of the book "Mehmed's Book: Soldiers Who have Fought in the Southeast Speak Out," written by Turkish journalist Nadire Mater, a freelance reporter with Inter Press Service (IPS). The court ruled that the book, first published in April 1999, had insulted the military and thus violated Article 159 of the Turkish Penal Code. Copies of the book, which consists of a series of interviews with forty-two retired Turkish soldiers who have fought in the civil conflict in southeastern Turkey, were confiscated by police from the book's Istanbul-based publisher, Metis Publishers. Since April, four editions of the book have been printed and around 9,000 copies sold. Mater also faces possible criminal charges under Article 159.

The ban was caused by a 28 June harsh editorial criticising Syria's failure to defend Lebanon during last week's Israeli air raids. The daily pointed out that "no single missile was fired against the Israeli warplanes by the Syrian air force which is supposed to defend Lebanon under the agreement which justifies their presence in Lebanon."

On 22 June, members of the youth wing of the Congress Party burned several copies of "The Greater Common Good", and Youth Congress President Himattsinh Patel threatened that "If within the next 24 hours, all [Roy's] irresponsible, anti-development books are not withdrawn from the shelves, the bookstores will have to face the wrath of angry Youth Congressmen." The BJP's youth wing held a similar demonstration on Saturday 24 July.

*505  $aNote: On 25 March the government decided not to renew the licence of the bimonthly "Detik". Since December, the newspaper's editors have been waiting for a decision from the ministry. According to Malaysian press law, all the printed media must request the renewal of their publishing permits every year. The editor of "Detik" has been accused by the authorities of failing to respect the conditions of the magazine's permit. In reality, the authorities are upset because he appointed a chief editor who was not favourable to the government.

*505  $aNote: Minister of Communications and Press Kikaya bin Karubi banned the publication of the newspaper "La Libre Afrique", as well as its supplements "Le Derby" and "Incognito" in the DRC on 10 May. The minister justified his decision by saying, "The administrative documents received by the newspaper 'La Libre Afrique' and its supplements 'Le Derby' and 'Incognito' were issued on the basis of false statements made to the administration with regard to the newspaper's and its printer's addresses, as well as the publication director's status as a professional journalist." Kikaya added that "La Libre Afrique" failed to fulfil its legal obligation to publish the name and the address of the printer in each copy of the newspaper, "which would allow for the verification of the newspaper's administrative and jurisdictional acts."

*505  $aNote: Print media outlets are adjusting to a June presidential decree requiring the press to print exclusively in the Latin script. The decree was intended to reduce the dominance of the Russian language in Azerbaijan. Josef Stalin imposed the Cyrillic script, which is derived from Russian, on Azerbaijan in 1939. Since then, most Azeri-language newspapers in the country have been printed in Cyrillic. One independent weekly tried to defy the decree and continue publishing in Cyrillic. But the August 9 edition of Impul's never appeared on newsstands because the government pressured the paper's printing house to block the issue. Officials summoned Impul's owner, Xan Husseyn Aliyev, to the Baku prosecutor's office and gave him an official warning for violating the regulation. The newspaper has since ceased publication.

*505  $aSince September 1997, the repression against journalists and 
newspapers has led 21 journalists to jail and shut down five weeklies. 
During the week of 12 January, two private dailies disappeared from 
news stands: "Fiyameta", which is close to the opposition, ceased 
publishing a few days after the unexplained arrest of its editor in 
chief, Dawit Kebede. The same thing happened to "Urji", a newspaper 
close to the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) guerrilla movement, whose 
editor, Wakshu Bacha, and deputy editor, Alemu Tolessa, were arrested 
on 23 December 1997

*505  $aThe provincial daily "Tous" was suspended for allegedly 
violating press law. The newspaper was reportedly charged with 
defamation, but no further details of the charge were given to the 
newspaper's editor-in-chief. The editor-in-chief was served a notice of 
the newspaper's suspension awaiting further legal action
*505  $aA Tehran court ordered the closure of the reformist daily Tous 
for allegedly violating Iran's press law. A Justice Department official 
said the paper had violated the law by using the same layout, content, 
and staff as a banned publication - the daily Jameah, which was Tous' 
predecessor. Despite the ruling, Tous resumed publication on August 2, 
under a different name, Aftab-e-Ruz. On the same day, a Tehran public 
court lifted the original ban, provided that the newspaper abide by 
regulations pertaining to layout
*505  $aJudicial authorities ordered the closure of the reformist daily 
Tous, effective September 16, for its "publication of articles against 
national security and general interests". Authorities sealed the Tous 
offices on the evening of September 15 and prevented distribution of 
the following day's edition. The paper's license was revoked on 
September 28

harsh step has been taken against so many newspapers simultaneously. 
The papers have been banned under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO)

stated that the reason for the action was the "printing of sensational

*505  $a"Avantgarden" was the first illegal paper to be printed in an 
illegal printing works. The first issue was published during the state 
of emergency in September 1941. The print was situated on the third 
floor in a public school in Oslo, although several hundred German 
soldiers lived in the school. Printing of the paper continued here 
until February 1942. In autumn of 1942 the main distributor, Rolf Lyng 
Nissen, was arrested, subjected to harsh interrogations and later 
deported to Sachsenhausen where he died. In summer of 1943 the editors 
split up, and the paper closed. Some group members started the paper 
"Svart paa hvitt". Publishing of "Avantgarden" was later resumed by the 
Norwegian Communist Party (NKP), now with the subtitle "hvori opptatt 
Aand og handling og: Organ for Aandsarbeider". Henrik Lunde, a most 
active member of the editorial staff, died during the shipwreck of the 
prison ship Westphalen

*505  $aThe Minister of Information and Media wrote to the head of the 
Azerbaijan publishing company, Nazim Ibragimov, ordering him to stop 
printing the independent daily "Avrazia". At a meeting with the 
newspaper's publisher, Irfan Sapmaz, the minister complained about six 
stories published recently in "Avrazia". Since 3 August 1996, Avrazia 
has ceased publication for an indefinite period. According to the RSF, 
the minister's move infringes Article 14 of the law on the media, which 
states that the decision to close a publication can only be taken 
either by its founder or by a court, and in no circumstances on the 
orders of a ministry

*505  $aSince 9 June 1998, several newspapers have been seized by 
police in Sindhulimadhi (320 km south-east of Kathmandu). The daily 
"Ajko Samacharpatra" and the weeklies "Jadanesh", "Janaahwan", 
"Yojana", "Jana Ekta" and "Jana Bhawana", all published in Kathmandu, 
were confiscated several times at the local market. Similar incidents 
were reported in other districts, such as Gorkha, Sindhuli, Rukum, 
Salyan, Tanahun, Dhading and Jajarkot, as the newspapers were about to 
be distributed. The newspapers had printed information about the 
misconduct of security forces, who are presumed to have killed civilians 
in clashes with Maoist guerrillas. Moreover, all articles that claim 
support for the Maoist movement because of government corruption have 
reportedly been banned

for having published articles deemed unethical ("contraires a 
l'ethique"). The paper was accused of having published sensational and 
exaggerated articles about crime, as well as articles that not only 
incited conflict between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims but which also 
jeopardized state security. "Akhir Khaber" was suspended on 1 July 1995 
for having published an article that criticized the press law. The 
suspension was lifted on 18 July

*505  $aSuspended by the Ministry of Information
*505  $aThe Ministry of Information ordered at least twelve weekly 
newspapers to suspend publication because they had reportedly failed 
to meet requirements of the amendments to the Press and Publications 
Law that Jordan's king Hussein ratified into law on 17 May 1997. The 
Ministry of Information asserted that the twelve newspapers had failed 
to comply with Article 24 of the law, requiring that weekly newspapers 
raise their capital from 15000 JD (USD 20000) to 300000 JD (USD 
400000). The newspapers were granted three months to restructure their 
finances, after which time they face permanent closure if they have not 
complied to the law. CPJ protested the unreasonable and arbitrary 
requirements of Article 24, which appeared specifically tailored to 
force closure of weekly newspapers which are financially weaker and 
have been known for their independent and critical views of the 
Jordanian government

requirement. Moreover, the amendments also provide for heavy sanctions

*520  $aAs an introduction to Alice Walker, this small book presents 
two of Walker's most interesting stories, "Roselily" and "Am I Blue," 
and the beginning of her prize-winning novel, The Color Purple. Further, 
the pages of Patricia Holt's introduction and the appendices of letters 
to the editors and meeting transcripts exemplify ways in which these 
fictional works have been the center of volatile controversy. They have 
been the subject of removal from tests (as in the case of there cent 
literature-based assessment tests in California), from school libraries 
and from school curricula. These controversies, played out in 
communities across the United States, cut to the heart of issues of 
censorship and democratic process.

Germans to find. The paper ceased to publish, and its editor started

as to contacts nationally
*505  $aPublication of the newspaper was upheld with great regularity 
in the Skien-Porsgrunn area, from the start of 1941. A driving force 
behind the paper was the parliament member Carl P. Wright. Several 
members of the group were arrested and sent to the Norwegian camp 
Grini. Most of them were subsequently deported either to Sachsenhausen 
or Natzweiler. The group had contacts within the Parliament, amongst 
them John Larsen. Larsen was persuaded by Wright to accept a position 
in the Reichskommissariat. Larsen obliged reluctantly, as he had to 
enlist in the NS. Larsen became most valuable to the newsgroup; 
obtaining pertinent information, also smuggling envelopes and stamps 
from the Reichskommissariat, enabling the group to distribute the paper 
nationally in the Reichskommissariats envelopes. When Larsen was 
discovered, he was subjected to severe torture during interrogations. 
He later died in Sachsenhausen. Carl P. Wright, arrested in 1941, was 
successfully freed by the group that published "London-nytt" and later 
transported to England. The total numbers of arrest is unknown, but at 
least 20 were sent to German concentration camps. Journalist Erling O. 
Pedersen died in police detention in Oslo due to torture. Borti 
Reichelt was later shot at Trandum

*520  $aAbortion, campaign financing, TV violence, homosexuality, and 
indecency on the Internet all have First Amendment implications, and all 
have been major political issues in the 1990s.During this decade, sex 
and secularism emerged as major targets of censorship, and an 
increasing number of Americans tested the limits of the Federal 
"decency" standards that were imposed on the arts, the broadcast media, 
and the Internet. America's interest in free expression has been 
paralleled by the growth of a powerful system of secrecy and censorship. 
This comprehensive encyclopaedia documents the full history of the 
struggle in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to define the 
modern contours of the First Amendment

*505  $aMoral reform movements claiming to protect children began to 
emerge in the United States over a century ago, most notably when 
Anthony Comstock and his supporters crusaded to restrict the circulation 
of contraceptive devices, information on the sexual rights of women, 
and "obscene" art and literature. Much of their rhetoric influences 
debates on issues surrounding children and sexuality today. In a book 
filled with Victorian accounts of pregnant girls, prostitutes, 
abortionists, Free Lovers, and others deemed "immoral," Nicola Beisel 
argues that rhetoric about the moral corruption of children speaks to an 
ongoing parental concern: that children will fail to replicate or exceed 
their parents' social position
*520 8$aIn a rare analysis of Anthony Comstock's crusade with the New 
York and New England Societies for the Suppression of Vice, Beisel 
examines how the reformer worked on the anxieties of the upper classes. 
Showing how a moral crusade can bring a society's diffuse anxieties to 
focus on specific sources, Beisel offers a fresh theoretical approach to 
moral reform movements

*520  $aThis striking study of America's battles over what we can 
decently say and do in public traces how and why principled debate about 
the character of our common world has been displaced by a new kind of 
public noise. Rochelle Gurstein offers a brilliant history of the 
arguments made for and against the forces - invasive journalism, realist 
fiction, and sex reform - that altered public discourse between the late 
nineteenth century, when they first appeared, and the 1960s, when 
new controversies erupted about mass culture, avant-garde art, and 
sexual liberation. Now the public sphere is dominated by rights talk, by 
puritan-baiting, and by knee-jerk liberalism or illiberalism. Is this 
the best we can do? Gurstein gives a detailed account of how the "party 
of exposure" successfully opened American public life to matters that 
had once been hidden away in private, and studies the unexpected 
consequences of that victory. And she retrieves a way of thinking, 
wrongly discredited as "Victorian," that could in fact move us beyond 
our stalemates over what should and what should not be said or done in 
public. Once, Americans influenced by the "party of reticence" held that 
if personal matters were exposed to public scrutiny they risked 
becoming trivial or obscene they thought that any indiscriminate display 
of private matters deformed standards of taste and judgement, lowered the 
tone of public conversation, and polluted public space. Ms.Gurstein's 
penetrating analysis suggests that we must reconsider these positions, 
and she establishes the vital connection between our legal-cultural 
history and current debates about obscenity, privacy, and issues of 
public decency.

banned by the South African authorities prior to its publication. The 
purpose of the booklet is to support the protests against torture which 
have been made by the churches in Namibia on several occasions since 
1967, not least in the form of a pastoral letter signed by the most 
prominent church leaders in 1977. The major part of the booklet 
consists of a number of sworn statements which were filed in a case

*505  $aOriginally the paper was named "Land og Folk", but eventually 
changed to "Arbeiderbladet" or "Total krig". At times the paper carried 
no name. The news group co-operated with the publishers of 
"Avantgarden". They were also members of the group behind "Svart paa
hvitt". Reidar Eker, Olav Torgersen and Gustav Sjaastad were arrested 
during the so called "Press crackdown" in 1944. In February 1944, the 
Nazi-authorities launched a major crackdown on illegal press 
activities, resulting in numerous arrests and closure of several 
newspapers

Torbergsen organised systematic listening to the forbidden B.B.C. He 
gathered trusted friends at his home and related the news from B.B.C. 
However, interest soon increased, and he began typing the news in 30 
copies which he distributed to trusted groups. Later the news were 
stencilled, and in the spring of 1945, the volume reached 250 copies

politician, saying that the contents discredited the government, the 
military and President Suharto. Attorney-General Singgih signed a 
decree banning "New era, new leader : Badio rejects the engineering by 
the new order regime", a 22-page book by Subadio Sastrosatomo, 78, a 
prominent politican of the 1950s. The title refers to Suharto's "New 
Order" government which started in 1968 following a bloody coup attempt 
blamed on the communists. The content "can cause unrest, undermine 
public trust in the government, ABRI (the Indonesian armed forces) and 
the national leader," a national newspaper quoted Singgih as saying

*505  $aA key decade in the postwar social and cultural history 
ofBritain, the period saw the country emerge from the 'doldrums era' of 
the fifties, to the permissive society of the 'swinging sixties'. A 
noticeable move towards 'decensorship' increasingly loosened the 
traditional constraints imposed on literature, stage, and films. Anthony 
Aldgate shows, however, that censorship altered the progression of the 
artistic and creative renaissance of this period, and how the process 
brought changes in the works of writers such as John Osborne, Shelagh 
Delaney, Alan Sillitoe, John Braine,Frederic Raphael, and Keith 
Waterhouse, and directors such as Tony Richardson, Lindsay Anderson,John 
Schlesinger, and Lewis Gilbert
*505  $aDrawing upon a mass of recently released or hitherto unseen 
documentation - including records, files, and photographs from the 
British Board of Film Censors and theLord Chamberlain's Office - Anthony 
Aldgate charts the impact of the censorship process between 1955 and 
1965 uponplay wrights and directors, many of whom endured the rigorous, 
sometimes rancorous, though often also fruitful,scrutiny of the film and 
theatre censors
*520  $aStage or film presentations of Look Back in Anger, A Taste of 
Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Alfie, and Darling were much 
changed, even transformed, by censorship between1955-1965. Censorship 
and the Permissive Society explores the predicament writers and 
directors faced, and highlights the debate over the liberalizing or 
progressive aspects of the sea changes affecting British society at the 
time

*505  $aThe minister ordered the head of the national printing press to 
cease printing the newspapers "Le Bucheron" and "La Griffe". The ban 
follows a series of articles and caricatures on the Smalto scandal (the 
Italian tailor who was on trial in France for allegedly setting up 
prostitution ring whose clients are said to include President Bongo.) 
The Minister of the Interior affirmed that "due to the severity of the 
situation, and the discredit which the newspapers have brought upon the 
public image of the country", he found himself obliged to put a 
protective ban on "the publication and circulation of the newspapers 
"Le Bucheron" and "La Griffe""

Norway 1940 - 1945
*505  $aCirculation: 2000. Stencilled
*505  $aThe first issue was published in autumn of 1940 by the so 
called "R-group", a resistance movement. Several prominent politicians 
and press-people engaged in producing the paper, intended as a 
contactforum for the national resistance movement. Initially, 
"Bulletinen" was closely linked to "Fri fagbevegelse", but the two 
papers split up after the arrest of several members of "Fri 
fagbevegelse". Subsequently, numerous members of the "Bulletinen" group 
were arrested, many of which were sent to German concentration camps. 
Arne Krogh-Johanssen died in Mauthausen in 1945. Sigurd Evensmo and 18 
others were arrested during an attempt to sail to England. They were 
all executed, except for Evensmo, who also figured on the Gestapo death 
list. "Bulletinen" was taken over by Asbjoern Halvorsen and Gunnar 
Hansen, and when they were arrested, Jan Jansen took on the printing 
until he had to flee to Sweden. Ca. 150 issues were published, with an 
average of six pages
