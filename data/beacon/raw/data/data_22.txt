*505  $aThe ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has reinvigorated protests across the Arab region, resulting in clashes between security forces and protesters in Algeria, Bahrain, Iran and
Yemen, report the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Human Rights Watch and IFEX members in the region. In Algeria, security forces prevented journalists from covering anti-government protests in
major Algerian cities on 12 February. Kamel Amarni, secretary-general of the Algerian National Syndicate, told CPJ that security forces stopped and searched several journalists before confiscating
their equipment. Internet service was shut down for several hours on the day and Facebook accounts deleted across the country.

are still questions about whether the media will be able to operate freely in the post-conflict period, says SEAPA.

"Al-Tariq al-Jadid", reports the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Sofiene Chourabi, a reporter with "Al-Tariq al-Jadid", Security agents stopped and confiscated his equipment and ID, hacked and
disabled his blog and deleted pages from his Facebook account. Hannibal TV was prevented from airing a programme about the Sidi Bouzid protests, according to CPJ. Nessma Channel, also a pro-government
private broadcaster, was blocked from re-broadcasting a programme about the street protests. The Tunisian Internet Agency has blocked news websites, blogs, email accounts and Facebook pages carrying
critical content. CPJ research shows that the Tunisian Internet Agency is "modifying web pages on the fly to steal usernames and passwords for sites such as Facebook, Google and Yahoo!," deleting or
compromising accounts and even using the information to locate bloggers and their network of contacts.

commission of a crime or an act that creates "serious turmoil in society" through public speech, writings, drawings or audio-visual telecommunication. It does not require the alleged incitement to be
successful for penalties to be imposed, which include prison terms of six months to five years plus fines.

Assembly and is expected to come into force once Chávez signs it into law. The amendment limits access to websites if they disseminate content that incites violence against the President, and bans
media from producing messages that may constitute "media manipulations aimed at promoting confusion among citizens or at altering the public order" or those that "ignore the authorities." It also bans
messages that could "be contrary to the nation's security."

*505  $aBolivia's just-passed law against racism and discrimination has spawned a new outbreak of journalist protests. Bolivia's National Press Association (ANP), an IFEX interim member, argues that
the law threatens press freedom and imposes censorship because it gives the government the power to shut down media outlets or throw journalists in jail simply for writing about racism. Article 16
says that "any media outlet that endorses or publishes racist or discriminatory ideas will be liable to economic sanctions and the suspension of its operating licence."

Pakistan. The President's party took matters into its own hands and shut down media outlets carrying the story in Pakistan. Operators in Karachi were torched by PPP activists, backed by a contingent
of police, after operators refused to shut down transmissions of GEO TV and ARY News. After armed PPP activists attacked the Reno Cable Network offices in Karachi and assaulted its staff, the cable
operator was forced to block its transmissions. PPP activists stole and burned copies of the GEO-associated "Jang" and "The News" newspapers in Karachi and other parts of the country, and threats were
issued that delivery vans would be incinerated. On 10 August, newspapers continued to be burned, and one delivery van driver was assaulted.

presidential elections. The website of the same name, established after Gasasira went into exile in Uganda, has been blocked in Rwanda since 3 June. The weekly "Umuseso" was also suspended in April.
The Media High Council is seeking a court order to ban both publications indefinitely, arguing their articles are abusive toward officials and undermine national security, according to news reports.

the top 20 nations of the world on free expression rights, but received a low grade for access to information and the federal government, as well as attacks on the press and impunity. Articles in the
report cover defamation law, deadly attacks on journalists in the ethnic press, police impersonating journalists, government tactics to deny access to information, and Canadian journalists who have
been imprisoned and tortured while reporting in Iran and Somalia, among other issues. You can read the original here: http://www.ifex.org/canada/2010/05/03/review2009.pdf

prison in 2004 based on the archaic press law; his conviction was later overturned.

Sociedad (IPYS), the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) and other IFEX members. The cadenas violate the right of independent media to decide on its own content, says Reporters Without Borders
(RSF). Chávez's speeches can last for hours. Six stations refused to air the speeches, including RCTV Internacional, the most popular station in Venezuela, report the Committee to Protect Journalists
(CPJ) and other IFEX members. The director of CONATEL then told cable television operators that if they did not stop broadcasting RCTV they would face sanctions, says IPYS. RCTV is known for its
critical coverage of the President and his government.RCTV has functioned as a paid subscription channel since July 2007, after the Venezuelan government removed it from public airwaves, report IFEX

*520  $aAuthors Fredrik Erixon and Hosuk Lee-Makiyama are Directors of the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE). "Online censorship is about to take centre stage in the campaign
to improve conditions for human rights, cyber security and commercial freedom of exchange on the Internet. Online censorship may be a recent phenomenon, but censorship is not. Yet the extent and
impact of censorship has taken new forms, in some instances reached new heights, with the progressive spread of new communication technologies. Censorship and authoritarian control of the Internet has
a cascading effect, impinging on national security, external relations with foreign powers, human rights and commerce." "The view this paper purports is that foreign actors can help to redress this
imbalance by taking China to the WTO for flaunting its commitments. Principally, a WTO case against online censorship could not attack the entire system of censorship in China or any other country.
China, and possibly also other countries, is in violation of its WTO commitments when it uses censorship as a tool of discrimination and when its censorship actions are disproportionate to the stated
aim of the actions. Hence, the economic rights of other countries get violated by actions to censor the Internet and online communications."

*520  $aThis commentary maps out the rights provided for in the Declaration on human rights defenders and analyses what the different rights entail as well as the different aspects necessary to ensure
their implementation. The commentary also addresses the most common violations faced by defenders and provides a set of good practices and recommendations to facilitate States implementation of each
right. The aim of the commentary is twofold: to increase awareness of the rights provided in the Declaration and to serve as a practical tool for defenders and other practitioners working to ensure
respect for the rights to which they are entitled under this instrument. Despite efforts to implement the Declaration, human rights defenders continue to face numerous violations to their rights. It
is hoped that this commentary will assist all relevant stakeholders who strive for a safer and more conducive environment for defenders to be able to carry out their work. For any comments or
suggestions to this commentary please do not hesitate to contact the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders at defenders@ohchr.org

*505  $aTwo newspapers critical of the Cambodian ruling party were shut down permanently, while five men were convicted of "provocation" for distributing pamphlets critical of the state last week,
reports the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights (CCHR). Newspapers "The Water and Fire News" and "The World News" are owned by the same publisher and were ordered to stop publishing as of 3 August. The
papers had their licenses revoked as a result of a perceived insult to the Ministry of Information.
