*505  $aDistributed to illegal editors and group leaders, as well as 
people in key positions across the country. Distributed to Stockholm and 
the other allied capitals.
*505  $aIn July 1943 "Information" took over the distribution to all 
illegal editorial offices affiliated to the Illegal Press Union (Den 
Illegale Presses Faellesorganisation) - and provided hereafter the 
illegal press with Danish and allied news until the different bureau's 
merged 1 April 1944. "Information" received its material from legal 
editorial offices, who could not publish the material, from ministries, 
police, The Danish Freedom Council, illegal groups and the secret 
service. Gradually "Information" formed its own secret service with 
local reporters across the country. The paper was distributed by mail 
and courier in Denmark. Every day several copies were sent to Sweden, 
where they were reprinted and forwarded to the allied countries. The 
Gestapo tracked down the news group several times, many co-workers and 
couriers were arrested. Someone informed on the group in May 1944, 
which resulted in the arrest of one of the group members. He was deported to a 
German concentration camp, where he died during the winter of 1944/45. 
In October 1944 all members of the editorial staff were arrested, except 
from two members. Two of the arrested managed to be released, the 
others were held in the Danish camp Froeslev until the capitulation. The 
following co-workers died: Birger Mouritsen, Kjeld Frederiksen (S.E.), 
Peter Fyhn, Greve Ludvig Reventlow, Peter de Hemmer Gudme.

*505  $aThe Iranian government has banned the Tehran-based daily 
"Jahan-e Islam", which has not appeared since 8 February. On 9 
February, as the paper was going to press, the government Ministry of 
Culture and Islamic Guidance reportedly sent a communique to the 
printer of "Jahan-e Islam" and halted its publication. No official 
reason was given for the banning, and the authorities announced that 
they would detail the charges against "Jahan-e Islam" at a later date

*520  $aIn Mr. Smith Goes to Tokyo, Kyoko Hirano examines American 
censorship of Japanese cinema during the occupation of 1945-1952, 
exposing how the occupation government effectively used the Japanese 
film industry to serve its own ends: to inculcate "democratic" 
principles, to guard against a return to militarism, and, ultimately, to 
create a trustworthy ally in the Pacific. The first history of Japanese 
cinema under the American occupation, Mr. Smith Goes to Tokyo 
make sex tensive use of declassified occupation-government documents from 
Washington and Tokyo, censored screenplays, several hundred films, and 
interviews with Japanese directors, producers, and writers. Through an 
analysis of such classics as Akira Kurosawa's No Regrets for Our Youth 
(1946), long considered a standard in the "democratization film" 
genre, Hirano reveals that American authorities approved of films that 
featured baseball, American-style comedy, gunfights, kissing scenes, and 
Japanese men and women resisting fascism. She addresses 
Prohibited topics - ritual suicide, gambling, depictions of Mt. Fuji, 
and, above all, criticism of the United States- in discussions of such 
censored films as The Japanese Tragedy (1946) and Desertion at 
Dawn(1950). Hirano traces the history of occupation censorship from its 
beginnings, when the United States became the almost sole Allied 
occupying force under General Douglas MacArthur (who wished to make 
Japan the "Switzerland of Asia"), to its conclusion, with the signing 
of a bilateral defence treaty. The author distinguishes between an 
early, more liberal period of occupation, in which many of Japan's own 
repressive restrictions on political expression were lifted, and a 
longer regressive period, in which growing anti labour policies of the 
Cold War era sparked labour unrest in the Japanese film industry. Well 
illustrated with contemporary photographs and film stills, Mr.Smith 
Goes to Tokyo provides a singular account of the postwar export of 
American democratic ideals and it contributes to an understanding of 
both film history and modern U.S.-Japanese relations.

*505  $aInitially published "Send videre", then changed to 
"Joessingposten" in September 1940, when the author Ingeborg Refling 
Hagen became editor and leader for this group of intellectuals. The 
paper was published twice or three times weekly, printed in the editors 
home. With a large network of distributors, the amount of copies of 
each issue was considerable. Ingeborg R. Hagen was arrested in December 
1941, together with many of the group. In spite of severe 
interrogations, she never revealed the paper. She was ill during all 
her imprisonment. Two fellow members, Frithjof Reppen and Rolf Thallaug 
Olsen, were severely mistreated, then deported to German concentration 
camps, where Reppen died. Sonja Coucheron was deported to the women's 
camp of Ravensbruck. These members spent 3 1/2 years each in German 
concentration camps. As none of them revealed the paper, the remaining 
group could resume publishing of the paper.

*505  $aAs the editor Ingeborg R. Hagen, and many others of the group 
were arrested in December 1941 (publishing Joessingposten. 1), the 
remaining group resumed to publish the paper in January 1942, now 
weekly. Due to the decree issued by the Nazi regime in 1942, 
introducing death penalty for publishing illegal papers, the paper was 
published without name. Later it was published under these names: "Vi 
vil vinne", "Nei - nei - nei", "Raids". The group was engaged in other 
illegal activities. In June 1943, the Gestapo clamped down on the 
paper. 16 members were arrested, 4 fled to Sweden. Ellen Holtermann was 
deported to Ravensbruck. Anna Oestby was deported to a concentration 
camp in Poland, where she was freed by the Russians. Suffering from 
typhoid fever, she died in April 1954

*520  $aThe First Amendment Right of free speech is a fragile one. Its 
fragility is found no less in legal opinions than in no other 
specialized forms of public discourse. Both its fragility and 
its sometimes surprising resiliency are reflected in this book. It 
provides an examination of how the U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with the 
problem of restrictions on media coverage of the criminal justice 
system, as well as how lower courts have interpreted the law created by 
the Supreme Court. The author explores the degree to which the Court has 
created a coherent body of law that protects free expression values 
while permitting reasonable government regulation, and examines 
the Supreme Court's jurisprudence concerning prior restraints, 
post publication sanctions on the press, and their right of access to 
criminal proceedings.

published by a circle of resistance people who also had participated in 
other resistance groups. Parts of the material were obtained by 
removing German mail and archives from German offices. The group, who

amongst them the editor of the paper, Ib Mogens Bech Christensen, who 
was shot by the Germans 23 April 1945.

*505  $aOn 26 October 1997, lawyers acting for Kerzner served notice of 
their intention to bring an urgent application to hit bookstores in 
South Africa on 27 October. Kerzner's lawyers claimed that the book was 
"untrue, defamatory and an invasion of privacy" that breached the 
Divorce Act and depicted Kerzner as using unfair business means. The 
publishers agreed to suspend the sale and distribution of the book 
until the matter of a final interdict had been settled. On 3 December, 
the High Court ruled that evidence in the application for a final 
interdict would be heard behind closed doors. The judge made the ruling 
despite the fact that neither of the parties had applied for the 
evidence to be heard in-camera. Counsel for Kerzner submitted that the 
proceedings be held in open court but that contentious evidence not be 
published. However, the judge said indications were that the court was 
dealing with allegations that were allegedly libellous, injurious and 
allegedly false

*505  $aAn Iranian court handed down a six-month suspended sentence and a fine of 3 million rials (USD 1000) against Muhammad Reza Za'eri, managing director of the conservative weekly Khaneh. Za'eri was first summoned by the court in late July, and charged with insulting Islamic principles, the Iranian nation, and the values of the Islamic revolution by publishing a letter in the July 15 edition of the paper which criticized the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. On July 28, Khaneh's office was damaged in a petrol bomb attack believed to have been carried out by militants in retaliation for the letter. Za'eri was arrested on July 29. He was released following his conviction on August 3 on bail. On August 5, the same court permanently revoked Khaneh's license on the same charges levelled against Za'eri

*505  $aDistributed to clergymen and ecclesiastical circles across the 
country. Subsequently generally widespread.
*505  $aFrom January 1945 the paper was edited in co-operation with 
"Morgenbladet". Due to raids on the printing house, the paper had to 
close down between 15 April to 20 June 1944 until the news group 
managed to organise their own duplicator. One of the editors had to go 
underground, but participated in the work until he fled to Sweden in 
October 1944. In Sweden he organised a news service for "Kirkens front" 
and distributed at the same time the papers "Dansk Kirke", "Kirke-Nytt" 
and "Kirkelig pressetjeneste" in Sweden. Another editor had to go 
underground winter 1945, but continued to lead and edit the paper until 
the capitulation. Several co-workers were arrested. One collaborator, 
Viggo Vedel Brandt, who was part of the editorial staff from August 
1943, was arrested and deported to Germany, where he in February 1945 
died in Porta.
*503  $aPublished monthly July 1943 to May 1945, subsequently legal.

was stencilled in the home of Dagny and Osmund Broennum, both strongly 
engaged in various illegal activities. Osmund Broennum was executed at 
Trandum in Oslo in 1942, his wife Dagny, was deported to a German 
concentration camp. Two other members; Ola Hofmo and Erling Heiestad, 
were arrested, probably due to other illegal activities, and remained 
in German prison camps until the liberation

*520  $aHow free is the speech of someone who can't be heard? Not very 
- and this, Owen Fiss suggests, is where the First Amendment comes in. 
In this book, a marvel of conciseness and eloquence, Fiss reframes the 
debate over free speech to reflect the First Amendment's role 
inensuring public debate that is, in Justice William Brennan's words, 
truly "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open." By examining the silencing 
effects of speech - its power to overwhelm and intimidate the 
underfunded, underrepresented, or disadvantaged voice - Fiss shows how 
restrictions on political expenditures, hate speech, and pornography can 
be defended in terms of the First Amendment, not despite it. Similarly, 
when the state requires the media to air voices of opposition, or funds 
art that presents controversial or challenging points of view, it is 
doing its constitutional part to protect democratic self-rule from the 
aggregations of private power that threaten it. Where most liberal 
accounts cast the state as the enemy of freedom and the First Amendment 
as a restraint, this one reminds us that the state can also be the 
friend of freedom, protecting and fostering speech that might otherwise 
die unheard, depriving our democracy of the full range and richness of 
its expression.

*505  $aWhen the paper "Gnisten" was closed, some group members started 
this paper. At the end of 1944, the paper faced serious difficulties; 
one editor: Jan Schielderup Mathisen, was arrested in the street, but 
escaped. Three members of the editorial staff; Rolf Aall, Arvid Sveum 
and Anders Bratholm, were wanted by the Gestapo, but continued 
publishing the paper. Aall was arrested during a raid, and the paper 
was disclosed. Sveum and Bratholm continued working with other illegal 
papers

*505  $aPublished from March 5 1943 until the liberation, this paper 
became one of the largest radio papers in Oslo. Initially, the paper 
was produced by two young men, who made 40 copies on their home-made 
duplicator. The group extended rapidly, and soon produced several 
hundred copies, published twice weekly. Several of the distributors 
were arrested, as well as the owner of the printing office. With 
increased demand for the  paper, the group acquired new premises and 
machinery, and had at the end of the war a circulation of 4000 copies. 
Subsequently the paper published three times weekly, and daily in the 
weeks prior to the liberation

*505  $aCensored, Seized/banned by the Ministry of the Interior ; 
Censored by the Authorities
*505  $aThe 8 December 1996 edition of the French-language independent 
weekly "La Tribune" censored under Article 11 of the press law. 
Ministry officials seized all the copies of the paper which had been 
printed and did not hand over the distribution receipt. The paper was 
seized for carrying the translation of an article on slavery in 
Mauritania which appeared in a United States paper
*505  $aAction taken under Article 11 of the press law, which grants 
the Interior Ministry the power to arbitrarily suspend newspapers 
without explanation
*505  $aNumber 3 of the Arabic-language edition of the weekly "La 
Tribune" was censored on 10 November 1997. Although no official 
explanation was given for this measure, it appears to be related to the 
publication, in the preceding issue of the weekly, of an editorial 
critical to the policies of President Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya
*505  $aIssue no. 23 of the Arab-language version of the weekly 
independent was censored. Authorities have not provided any explanation 
for this measure. Since the beginning of 1998, there was six instances 
of suspensions and seizures by authorities, in accordance with article 
11 of the Press Law which allows the Minister of the Interior to 
arbitrarily censor newspapers without explanation
*505  $aThe Arab-language edition of the newspaper "La Tribune" was 
censored. Authorities offered no explanation for the action. This was 
the fifth time in less than a month that the newspaper was targeted by 
authorities

*505  $aThe organisation D.K.P.s main paper. As the party was 
forbidden in June 1941, it turns out to be one of the resistance 
movements' first illegal organisation, and at that time by far the 
largest. Pamphlets and leaflets were distributed already in July 1941. 
During the autumn of 1941, the "Politiske maanedsbreve" was 
distributed. The local divisions produced local editions of this paper. 
In March 1942, starting with no. 8, the paper changed its name to "land 
og folk" with the subtitle "Politiske maanedsbreve". This name was kept 
until 3 May 1945, whereas it changed to "Folkets dagblad" with the 
subtitle "Land og folk". This paper published two issues only, whereas 
it changed its name back to "Land og folk". Manuscripts from the main 
editorial office were copied by innumerable groups in Copenhagen and 
most provincial towns. The party soon obtained their own book printing 
houses, both in the capital and in the provinces, and the paper had a 
large circulation. The party also distributed "Ugens nyheder", which 
published from January to December 1943. This paper shut down as the 
newspaper "Information" was able to distribute daily all over the 
country. Many other papers were published by the "D.K.P.", who, better 
than any other illegal resistance organisation, managed to distribute 
during the first critical years of the occupation. The "D.K.P." also 
distributed several plays, books and other publications.

*505  $aThe decree claims that the book is anti-western and enshrines 
values opposed to the "fundamental laws and values" of France. The book 
expounds Islamic views on the conduct of daily life: food and drink, 
ritual slaughter, marriage, and other social and commercial 
relationships. The decree was based upon powers given the Ministry of 
the Interior under Article 14 of the Press law of 1881. Article 14, as 
amended in 1939, endows the Minister of the Interior with 
discretionary power to ban foreign, but not French, publications

*505  $a"Le Messager" was seized and banned from publishing, and its 
editors continue to be threatened. On 12 May 1995 in the morning, Isaie 
Niyoyita, the new editor (who is legally responsible for the paper), 
was visited by an inspector of the judicial police, Jean-Baptiste 
Kasungu, who served him a summons from the Public Prosecutor's office. 
Niyoyita was named in the summons for articles which had "sowed hatred 
between the population and the government." The articles, taken to the 
printer on 9 May, were to be published in the next issue of "Le 
Messager". The inspector added that "on order of the Minister of 
Justice" Niyoyita would be immediately imprisoned if these articles 
were published. At the end of the day, Kasungu returned to the printer 
to seize the paper while it was being printed
