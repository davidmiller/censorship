confiscated from newsstands the 24 December edition of "Al-Mawkif", an 
opposition weekly, and the 25 December issue of opposition paper

street protests. The Tunisian Internet Agency has blocked news websites,

censor and ban media from disseminating news that

satellite television stations, online television channels, publications, 
community cstations and more than 1,000 websites
