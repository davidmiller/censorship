*520  $aTension between free speech and social stability has been a 
central concern throughout American history. In the 1960s that concern 
reached a fever pitch with the anti-Vietnam War movement. When antiwar 
sentiment "invaded" American schools, official resolve to retain order 
inthe classroom vied with the rights of students to speak freely. A key 
event in that face-off was the Supreme Court decision in Tinker v. Des 
Moines. As the most important student rights case ever to reach the 
Supreme Court, Tinker raises important issues regarding First Amendment 
freedoms and provides a fascinating legal window on a turbulent era.

Norway, on Penal code 323, on the grounds that it contained several 
statements thought to be liable to punishment on Penal code 95. 
Charges were raised against two russians living in Vardoe (Vassili F.

*505  $aA paper for youths started by "D.K.U.". The editorial staff 
worked closely with "Land og folk", "Dansk presse" and "Ungdommens 
front, Horsens". Similar groups were quickly established in the 
provinces. In December 1943 the Gestapo seized the printing house, and 
several group members were arrested in the spring of 1945. However, the 
paper continued to publish. Several of the arrested were tortured, and 
some were deported to German concentration camps. One of the founders, 
Kjeld Rasmussen, died in the concentration camp Neuengamme.

*505  $aThe paper is a continuation of "Den frie danske pressetjeneste" 
and "Moen nyhedstjeneste". The editor had to flee to Sweden with two 
co-workers. The new editorial staff and the reorganised news group was 
raided by the Gestapo several times, and the publication ceased for a 
period of time. During the persecution of Jews in the autumn of 1943, 
the paper shut down for a month, as the group was engaged in organising 
transportation of Jews to Sweden. In March 1945 the paper closed down 
as the group was engaged in other illegal activities.
*505  $aDistributed: Moen and Sydsjaelland
*503  $aThe issues were not numbered, and the paper shut down 
occasionally due to Gestapo raids. Only the issues that the Danish 
royal library holds, can be stated: 1944: 20.08, 01.09; 1945: Vol. 3,

"Vetcherniuj Sebastopol" ("Seastopol this evening"), was arrested and 
sentenced to ten days in prison for "not having respected the decision 
of a court". The newspaper had been fined 3000 grivna (USD 200) and 
made to publish a reply by Sebastopol mayor Viktor Semenov denying 
charges of corruption which were made by the paper in the end of 1996. 
Kravchenko was imprisoned because the paper had not obeyed the decision 
to print the reply. The Leninski tribunal ordered that the paper's 
computers be confiscated

"Instruksjonskurs for bestyrere av de tekniske aftenskoler 26 juni-1

*505  $aThe publication was deliberately held back by the publisher 
Agnar Kirste and the Professional teaching advisor, Klaus Konrad 
Torgaard, on the grounds that the author was a member of the political 
party "Nasjonal Samling", which collaborated with the German 
occupational forces in Norway in the Second World War. The publication 
was suppressed and condemned after the Second World War

*505  $aThe daily "Ziua" had to suspend its printing for the second 
time in a month because the Letea paper mill refused to deliver the 
necessary amount of newsprint. The editors of "Ziua" say that their 
publication does not owe money to the supplier, and they suspect 
political reasons for withholding the delivery. At the end of 1994, 17 
of Romania's major publications announced to their readers that they 
may shut down. The state-owned Letea paper mill is the only supplier of 
newsprint in the country
