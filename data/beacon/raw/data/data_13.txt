*505  $aOn 16 October 2003, Information and Culture Minister Sayeed Makhdoom Raheen closed the state-owned "Arman-e-Mili" ("The National Will"), which carried articles criticising President Hamid Karzai's administration. The move appeared to violate the government's commitments with respect to the independence and development of state media. "Arman-e-Mili"'s last issue appeared on 11 October 2003, after the government ordered its "administrative closure". The information and culture minister said the measure was "of a budgetary nature." Agence France-Presse quoted the minister as saying at a press conference, "There are currently 265 dailies, weeklies and other publications in Afghanistan. Five of them belong to the government and are subsidised by public funds. They often carry the same articles and the same photos, so we decided to close one of them." However, the daily's editor-in-chief, Mirhaidar Motahar, claimed the closure is linked to the paper's increasingly independent editorial line. He said "Arman-e-Mili" had often reported on popular discontent with government decisions. As the newspaper received part of its financing from the Defence Ministry, its closure could also be linked to power struggles within the government. Defence Minister Mohammed Fahim heads a major opposition current within the transition government. As "Arman-e-Mili" very rarely criticised Fahim, President Karzai's associates may have suspected the paper of being in the pay of the minister. "Arman-e-Mili" had a circulation of 5,000 copies, one of the largest in Afghanistan. It employed 17 journalists and about 15 other employees.

*505  $aNational security officers closed "Aftab", a socio-political weekly, on 17 June and arrested both Sayeed Mirhassan Mahdawi, editor-in-chief of "Aftab", and Ali Payam, deputy editor. Kabul police searched and then closed Aftab's offices, and Afghanistan's intelligence agency, the Amniat-e Melli, confiscated remaining copies of the newspaper from local booksellers and stores. Prior to the arrests, Mahdawi reportedly received death threats by telephone after publishing two articles raising questions about Islam's place in politics and methods of interpreting religious texts, and criticizing Afghan religious leaders. The pair were released from detention on 25 June and are now seeking protection from international agencies, amid fears for their safety. 
*506  $bChief justice Fazl Hadi Shinwari
*506  $eThe Supreme Court charged Mahdavi and Sistany with the crime of "insulting Islam," or blasphemy. The existing penal code of Afghanistan does not define blasphemy, but provides that certain crimes relating to Islam are punishable under shari'a (Islamic law). Crimes under shari'a are not codified or defined under Afghan law, but under most interpretations of shari'a, blasphemy is a serious offense sometimes punishable by death.

The authorities in Jalalabad banned the sale of "Frontier Post" in Nangarhar province on 18 February 2003.

The suspension of the dailies provoked widespread condemnation within the Algerian independent media community and civil society, with some political groups seeing this decision as a clear governmental attempt to interfere with the editorial position of these newspapers in advance of next year's elections. Of the six newspapers that were asked on 18 August to immediately repay their debts to the state-owned printing firms, only "L'Expression" and "Er-Raï" were unable to do so and have not reappeared as of 3 September.

*505  $aA mob of about 30 men attacked the offices of "Yeni Musavat" on the evening of 4 May, threatening to kill editor-in-chief Rauf Arifoglu, who was not present at the time, and causing extensive damage. Several employees were injured in the attack. The attackers told the journalists to stop writing about President Aliev's precarious health and to stop criticising the authorities. Arifoglu said police protection of the office, which had begun three days earlier, was withdrawn two hours before the attack. The journalists had anticipated the attack and asked for a police guard. The move came after government officials called for the paper to be "punished" after articles appeared in the government press accusing "Yeni Musavat" of being an "enemy of the nation" for having called on Aliev to resign for health reasons. On 2 May, police seized 1,800 copies of the paper's Russian-language edition at the Viza-Media printing house in Baku and arrested four journalists, including Azer Aykhan, Firdovsi Akhmedov and Sayyad Gadirli. The head of the printing house, Aliovst Talishkhanly, and two other employees were also arrested for publishing "anti-government" material.

The Pakistani authorities said the article "insulted" the Koran and "could cause disturbances." The article reported that a German linguist believes the Koran may have originally been written in Aramaic, rather than Arabic, and that this would explain a number of errors of interpretation concerning the veil, the reward given to martyrs, and even the origins of the Koran itself. The Customs Department checks the content of all foreign publications on arrival in Pakistan. If an article is considered contrary to Pakistani law, it is referred to the Press Information Department.

According to Gustavo Guzmán, Pulso's editor-in-chief, several individuals in a green van who pretended to be Pulso staff members confiscated copies of the weekly in a southern area of La Paz. Newspaper vendors later confirmed those reports to the weekly. Pulso, which circulated normally in the rest of the city, also discovered that someone had been buying copies in large numbers in a northern area of La Paz. Guzmán said they suspect that government officials might have been attempting to take copies of the weekly out of circulation. The La Paz daily El Diario also claimed that unidentified individuals had confiscated several copies of its October 15 edition, which included an article discussing Sánchez de Lozada's possible resignation.

*505  $aOn 19 February 2003, a news blackout on the Burmese banking crisis was imposed by the military junta. The Literary Works Scrutinising Committee (LWSC), an Interior Ministry offshoot responsible for censorship, summoned the editors of Burma's main privately-owned newspapers to a meeting on 19 February. The editors were threatened with reprisals if they published any reports on the banking crisis. Officials explained that the news blackout is intended both to prevent the situation from deteriorating further and to put a stop to rumours. The Burmese government is one of the few in the world to impose prior censorship on privately-owned publications.

*505  $aOn 4 March 2003, the premises of the Nepalese-language newspaper "Sunchari Samachar", in Siliguri (in West Bengal state's Darjeeling district) was subject to a bomb attack. RSF said it feared local journalists would be tempted to censor themselves when reporting on sensitive subjects since no clues have been found to determine who was behind the 4 March attack, in which a powerful bomb exploded in front of the newspaper's offices without causing injury. The "Times of India"'s Siliguri correspondent said the blast may have been linked to "Sunchari Samachar"'s coverage of the situation in the Darjeeling Gorkha Autonomous Hill Council region. "Sunchari Samachar", which has a circulation of 25,000 copies, was banned from the region in 1998, but the paper's editor said after the attack that he had good relations with officials in the region. Siliguri is located near the borders of Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Tibet.

*505  $aOn 13 April, the Société de presse et d'édition du Cameroun (Sopécam), a state-owned printing press, refused to publish the Monday 14 April edition of the Yaoundé-based "Mutations". Police later seized the computer disk containing that edition of the paper and detained two of the printer's employees for questioning. Local sources said that the seizure of the disk was prompted by an extensive report on President Biya's succession titled, "After Biya: The Uncertainties of the End of His Rule," which was to appear in Monday's edition. The report discussed the possible political and ethnic turmoil that could ensue in the event of Biya's retirement. On 14 April, police went to "Mutations"' offices and detained the newspaper's publisher, Haman Mana. Mana was released later that night and was told to return to the station the next day with the journalists who were responsible for the article. On 15 April, Mana, editor-in-chief Alain Blaise Batongué and editor Emmanuel Gustave Samnick reported to the police station. The three were detained all day, questioned about the article, and released early that evening, journalists at "Mutations" said. The newspaper was unable to publish on 14 and 15 April. When officials found that "Mutations"' 16 April edition contained the same report, police began seizing copies of the paper from vendors as it appeared on the streets.

*505  $aOn 15 October 2003, the trial of dissident He Depu was held in a Beijing court. He was accused of collaborating with the banned China Democracy Party and of using the Internet to distribute messages "inciting subversion". He Depu has lost a great deal of weight and his health has deteriorated seriously. His wife said he has a liver ailment and his condition is very worrying. He Depu was born on 28 October 1956. He took part in the Democracy Wall movement in 1979 and founded the magazine "Beijing Youth", which was subsequently banned. He also helped launch the now-banned China Democracy Party and was detained several times for his political activities. He lost his job with the Social Sciences Academy after standing as a candidate in local elections in 1990.

*505  $aThe Chinese government banned the bimonthly business news magazine Caijing. The June 20 edition of the influential magazine was barred from newsstands. Although the magazine reached subscribers during the weekend, authorities ordered additional copies held at the printers. While no official reason was given for the banning of the magazine, the June 20 edition contained articles on several taboo topics including a cover story on a bank loan scandal linked to government officials and an article on the impact of SARS. The magazine is published by a government-backed financial think tank, and made waves last month when it ran an interview with SARS whistle blower Dr. Jiang Yonyang.

*505  $aBeijing Xinbao, a weekly news tabloid run by the national newspaper Workers' Daily, was shut down by Chinese government authorities, and its editors were sacked after running an article critical of the Chinese government in its June 4 edition. The article, entitled "Seven Disgusting Things in China," violated national publication regulations according to the Chinese newspaper Wen Wei Po. A spokesman from the publication administration of the Communist Party told the Associated Press that communist authorities have called a review of all of China's newspapers and magazines, and that more publications might be closed. The Ministry of Propaganda has also recently banned Chinese journalists from writing about specific subjects including the handling of the SARS outbreak, and has censored several newspapers and magazines.

Zakaria Cheik Ibrahim. Following the court hearing, Farah was taken back to Djibouti's Gabode prison, from which he had been released following a lower court's decision on 23 June. The Appeals Court also handed Farah an additional three months' suspended jail sentence, ordered him to pay 13 million Djibouti francs (about US Dollars 73,600; 65,000 euros) in damages, fined him 200,000 Djibouti francs (about US Dollars 1,130; 1,000 euros) and banned his newspaper from appearing for three months. Farah, who also heads an opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Renewal (MRD), has been arrested several times in recent years. In most cases he was accused of press crimes and was fined or sentenced to prison terms.

On 17 March, Farah was sentenced to a suspended sentence of six months in prison and a fine of 200,000 FD (approx. US Dollars 1,200; 1,000 euros). "Le Renouveau" criticised the army again on 17 April, accusing it of lacking "neutrality" and stating that it "should be apolitical." Farah was arrested three days later and placed in solitary confinement in Gabode prison. Only his mother was allowed to visit him. His request for temporary release was turned down on 30 April. A few days after his arrest, the Djibouti special police went to Farah's home and to the MRD's (the Movement for Democratic Renewal and Development) headquarters, where they confiscated seven typewriters, an amplifier, photocopier ink cartridges, and all of the newspaper's files, without showing a search warrant. On the morning of 5 May, police confiscated the latest issue of the newspaper from news stands and newspaper vendors. Farah has been detained several times in the past few years. In most cases, he was prosecuted for a press crime and sentenced to prison terms or fines.

Federal agents took control of the media holdings, including the daily "Listin Diario", on the grounds that the authorities needed to protect assets said to belong to the bank. A court order stated 30 July that the Editora Listín Diario publishing company be restored immediately to its owners after being placed in official receivership by monetary authorities investigating an alleged multi-million dollar fraud by a bank closely linked to the company. The judge who heard a request for injunction filed by the Báez family seeking the return of the four newspapers published by their company, among them the 100-year-old Listín Diario, ruled that the 15 May seizure of the papers was unconstitutional.

The library removed the book following protests and opened an inquiry into the matter. The librarys director Ismail Serageldin said there was an error in displaying 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'. The book, which was the texts first Arabic translation, completed in 1951, had been put on display in the manuscripts museum, which is part of the new library. It was withdrawn from the museum after articles appeared in the Egyptian and Israeli press. UNESCO has inquired with Egypt's Alexandria Library about allegations of possible anti-Semitism in its display of the book and has asked the library to assure UNESCO that it hasn't left itself open to possible racism charges.

*505  $aOn September 18 2001, Eritrean authorities banned all non-state print media outlets following calls from senior politicians for political reform and the appearance of editorials on democracy and human rights in the local press. Officials sealed off the newsrooms of weekly publications, such as Meqaleh, Setit, and Tsigenay, and seized the newspapers' equipment, according to sources in Eritrea's capital, Asmara. Within days, the government began rounding up journalists, arresting at least 10 by the end of the month. Several more reporters went into hiding or fled the country. On World Press Freedom Day, May 3, 2003, CPJ named Eritrea one of the world's 10 Worst Places to be a Journalist. As of October 2003, eighteen journalists languish in prison, most of them held incommunicado in unknown locations.

*505  $aOn 17 September 2003, police seized the third edition of the satirical bimonthly "Sub-Version" at the airport in the capital, Libreville, and detained four of the paper's staff for questioning for several hours. Kimote Memey, Abel Mimongo, Stanislas Boubanga, and Chartrin Ondamba had gone to the airport to collect copies of the paper, which is printed in Cameroon to reduce costs. On 19 September, the National Council on Communications (CNC) sent a letter to the newspaper's publications director ordering "Sub-Version" to cease publication. The letter also accused "Sub-Version" of carrying articles "attacking the dignity of the president, his family, and the institutions of the Republic." Journalists at the newspaper told CPJ that the order stemmed from an article that appeared in the paper's second edition on 20 August suggesting that first lady Lucie Bongo was meddling in politics.

The issue was printed in neighbouring Cameroon after Gabon's state-run press refused to print it. On 23 December, journalists at the newspaper received a letter from the National Council on Communications (CNC), dated 19 December, ordering that the paper be suspended indefinitely. The letter accused the newspaper of publishing articles that might "disturb public order". According to local journalists, the issue contained an editorial criticising the government's repression of the private press in Gabon, as well as an article accusing the government of mismanaging revenues from the country's oil industry. The editor-in-chief of the independent newspaper "L'Autre journal," Marco Boukoukou Boussaga died on 15 December 2003 after he was found spitting up blood and brought to the hospital.

According to MFWA-Guinea sources, the paper's 30 September edition included a story entitled, "Amadou Kouyate cuts off his genitals because of a false rendezvous". The article included a picture of a man showing what remained of his severed male organ. The CNC described the picture, used as a banner headline, as an affront "to propriety and a violation of the rules of media ethics and professional code of conduct."

The newspaper's editor-in-chief, one Mr. Maarif, went into hiding after military intelligence officers interrogated him for 10 hours on 5 December 2003, in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. The army personnel was critical of the content of some of the paper's reports. In an article published in late November, entitled, "The Acehnese people do not need elections", the biweekly had criticised the government's decision to maintain martial law in Aceh and questioned the legitimacy of elections scheduled for next year. Launched in March 2003, "Beudoh" is opposed to martial law.

Faghihi was also summoned and detained for several hours on the same day. Mandegari's arrest followed the publication of an article discussing what was at stake for the regime in the signing of a protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). All discussion of this subject is banned under censorship imposed by the NSC, the body that rules on all state security issues. Every week the council sends all newspapers a list of banned subjects, such as student demonstrations in 1999, the resumption of dialogue with the United States, the death of Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi, or more recently anything connected with the signing of the IAEA. 
It is occasionally possible to report on facts or statements made by Iranian political figures on these subjects but any analysis of the issues is forbidden. "Entekhab" had revealed that Parliament and the presidential body officially responsible for the signing of the protocol were excluded from the process in favour of an ad hoc committee set up by the Supreme Guide of the Islamic Revolution.

*505  $aOn 8 January 2003, the reformist newspaper "Hayat-é-No" reprinted a 1937 United States (US) newspaper cartoon about the pressure exerted by then-President Franklin Roosevelt on the US Supreme Court, represented by a bearded, black-robed old man resembling the Islamic regime's founder, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. It was printed alongside an interview with a social science professor about "social collapse" in Iran. The conservative-dominated Religious Court ordered the newspaper closed on 11 January. The cartoon was considered insulting to Khomeini's memory. The court also summoned the paper's editor, Hedi Khamenei, for questioning. On 12 January, religious organisations in the holy city of Qom staged street protests. Intelligence Minister Ali Yunessi then announced the arrest of three of the newspaper's journalists: Alireza Eshraghi, Hamid Ghazvini and Rahman Ahmadi. Ghazvini was released on 12 January. Editor Hedi Khamenei, who is also the brother of Ali Khamenei, the country's spiritual leader and official "Guide of the Revolution", but does not share his views, accused Eshraghi and Ahmadi of being responsible for printing the cartoon. He had earlier apologised for what he called a "misunderstanding."

*505  $aThe book "The Tragedy of Democracy in Iran", was withdrawn from sale in July 2000, a few weeks after its publication. The reason for withdrawal being that the author mentions the murder of five intellectuals and opposition figures in 1998. The author, Emadoldin Baghi, a journalist with the banned daily newspapers "Neshat" and "Fath" was on 17 July 2000 sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for "undermining national security" and "spreading unsubstantiated news stories". On 23 October 2000, his sentence was reduced to three years' imprisonment. Baghi was jailed for writing an editorial in the daily paper "Neshat" in September 1999 in which he called for Islam to adopt a modern approach to the death penalty. On 6 February Baghi was released, and then told he would be summoned on 8 March 2003 to face new charges in connection with articles he wrote in the reformist press accusing top regime officials of involvement in the 1998 murder of the five intellectuals and opposition figures.

His arrest was due to the campaign orchestrated by judicial officials and revolutionary guards in the mosques and conservative press in which all the detained students and journalists were accused of being "mohareb" (persons who fight against God), a crime punishable by death.   .

*505  $aThree months after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, at least 85 newspapers and magazines emerged, dozens of once-banned Internet cafés opened and stores sold satellite TV dishes again. However, these gains in press freedom were threatened by violent crime and restrictions imposed on the media by US and British coalition forces. RSF expressed concern that the Coalition Provisional Authority's (CPA) order in June banning "inimical media activity" encouraged self-censorship. The CPA order gave coalition troops the authority to raid premises and cancel licences on the grounds of inciting or potentially inciting violence against the CPA, inciting "racial, ethnic or religious hatred" and promoting "civil disorder, rioting or damage to property." Media outlets advocating support for the Baath Party, advocating "alterations to Iraq's borders by violent means" and putting out news that is "patently false and calculated to promote opposition to the CPA" could also be penalized. The Coalition military commander had the sole power to decide what constituted incitement.

*505  $aAfter the 1958 revolution, media censorship became a way of life in Iraq. In this very unstable environment, the freedom that had been extended to journalists gradually started to erode, while more and more newspapers were shut down. In 1979, Saddam Hussein became Iraq's President. All of the newspapers that had failed to support the Ba'ath Party's rise to power were closed. It was then that the systematic and bloody persecution of dissidents and journalists began. Since 1979, dozens of them have had to endure judicial and police harassment, jailings and torture. A large number of them have either been executed or have vanished. What distinguished the Ba'athist regime was that its reign of terror not only targetet journalists but their families and communities as well. The use of satellite television as a weapon of pressure and blackmail proved that intimidations by Saddam Hussein's regime could reach far beyond the country's borders. Following the Persian Gulf War (1991), Uday Saddam Hussein - the Iraqi President's eldest son - became the kingpin of media censorship, free to award privileges or impose terror tactics at will. As chairman of the Iraqi Journalists' Union, and a press magnate, the man who insists on being called the "dean of journalists" had total control over the print media, radio and television.

He had been tipped off about its contents while the newspaper was still at the printers. It is a common occurrence for "informers" to be posted at semi-governmental printing houses in order to verify the content of publications.

*505  $aOn February 17 2003, Nasser Qamash, Roman Haddad, and Mohannad Mubaidin, editor-in-chief, managing editor, and writer, respectively, for the weekly magazine Al-Hilal, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to six months for publishing an article that insulted the Prophet Mohammed and contained "false rumors," "insulted the dignity of the state," and caused instability-all of which are crimes under Jordan's Penal Code. Mubaidin was sentenced to six months in prison, while Haddad received two months, and Qamash three months. The court retroactively banned Al-Hilal for two months beginning January 16, when the State Security Court prosecutor had initially halted the magazine's publication. On February 18, the court commuted the prison sentences against Qamash and Haddad into fines, and both men-who have been detained since January 16-were released the same day. However, the article's author, Mubaidin, who was also arrested on January 16, began serving his sentence immediately. The charges against the three journalists stemmed from an article published in the January 14 edition of the weekly that described in sexual terms why the Prophet Mohammed preferred Aisha over his other wives.

He now spends nights at his office in central Monrovia. The whereabouts of his family are unknown. Ponnie, who is the former editor of "The Concord Times" newspaper, has been a constant victim of harassment and death threats for allegedly embarking on a campaign to discredit President Charles Taylor's government. In 1999, "The Concord Times", relying on the auditor general's annual report, published a series of articles that pointed to corruption in the government. The paper was banned by Taylor's government in 2000.

"Al-Zahf Al-Akhdar", the organ of Libya's revolutionary committees, as well as other official publications, reportedly criticised and insulted certain Arab countries, including Bahrain and Kuwait. Some articles apparently reported that the kingdom of Bahrain could not be considered "a state, a half state or even a quarter state". Kuwait was apparently defined as a "topographical error, which has never been corrected." The newspaper's suspension came during a strained political climate between Libya and the Arab states.

*505  $aOn 23 September 2003, the Interior, Posts and Telecommunications Ministry seized issue 80 of the Arabic-language newspaper "Essahifa". 
Ministry officials claimed the action was in keeping with Article 11 of the 1991 Law on Press Freedom in Mauritania, Act 91-023, which allows for seizure "by order of the Interior Ministry" of publications that may be considered "likely to undermine the principles of Islam or the image of the state, to harm the public good, to compromise public order and security."

*505  $aThe French fortnightly "Afrique Education" may be the victim of indirect censorship in Mauritania, as the Mauritanian distributor decided to stop distribution. In a 27 November 2003 letter, the distributor, Les Vents du Sud, told French publisher Messageries de la Presse Parisienne (NMPP) that it no longer wanted to receive the journal, which covers educational issues in Africa. The reasons for the decision could have been purely economic. However, it followed the publication of an editorial on Mauritania's presidential election in the 16-30 November issue that described the regime and its president, Colonel Maawiya ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, as "pro-slavery" and called the president "a petty racist".

*505  $aOn August 4 2003, a Rabat court sentenced three journalists to prison for violating Morocco's new anti-terrorism law. Editors Mohammed al-Herd and Abdel Majid Ben Taher, of the weekly newspaper Al-Sharq, and Mustapha Qashnini, editor of the weekly Al-Hayat al-Maghribiya, were found guilty of "extolling the actions that comprise terrorism," according to their lawyer Mohammed Ziyyan. al-Herd was sentenced to three years in prison, while Ben Taher and Qashnini, who were released the previous month pending trial, were each sentenced to a year in prison. The court also suspended both weeklies from publication for three months. The charges against the journalists stem from an article by an Islamic activist named Zakariya Boughrara that appeared in the May 5-May 20 issue of Al-Hayat al-Maghribiya and was reprinted on June 5 in Al-Sharq. In the article, Boughrara discussed the history of the Islamist movement in Morocco and its relationship with the country's intelligence services. The article, which criticized the Moroccan intelligence services for doing the "dirty work" of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, was written before the suicide attacks in Casablanca on May 16 that claimed 44 lives. The Moroccan government blames the Islamist group Salafiyya Jihadia for the crime, and Boughrara is a member of the group.

After the publication of his book "Mullah ka Kirdar" ("The Mullah's Role") in 2000, local clerics banned the book and issued a religious ruling declaring Wahab a "non-believer." In 2002, Wahab also published a book critical of Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan's Taliban regime.

Like most Rwandan publications, the weekly is published in Uganda, where printing costs are cheaper. Copies of other newspapers were allowed in without incident. "Indorerwamo"'s representative, who was to take copies of the weekly to Kigali, was detained by police for several hours. The copies of the weekly were sent to police headquarters in Kigali. The paper's publisher, Ismael Mbonigaba, was arrested on 22 January 2003 and imprisoned for five weeks for writing in another independent publication, "Umuseso", that former prime minister Faustin Twagiramungu would stand against President Paul Kagame in the next presidential election.

Editor Robert Sebufirira was arrested on November 19 near the Rwanda-Uganda border as he was bringing back 4,000 copies of the newspaper from the printers. The newspaper is printed in Uganda for financial reasons. Police seized the copies and took Sebufirira to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in Rwanda's capital, Kigali. Later that day, Umuseso deputy editor Kalisa McDowell; journalists Furaha Mugisha, Emmanuel Munyaneza, and Charles Kabonero; and driver Budeyi Nassan went to CID to inquire after Sebufirira and were also detained. Sebufirira said the journalists were separated and interrogated about an article in the seized edition of the newspaper, which questioned why certain senior army officers were being demobilized. He said the article also questioned why taxpayers' money had been used to send Major General Kyumba Nyamwasa, director of the national security services, on a U.K. training course if he was being demobilized.

Al-Huwaider is the latest of a number of journalists whom the government has barred from writing.

*505  $aThe Tamil-language weekly "Thinamurasu" has continously been harassed by the Tamil Tigers. A "Thinamurasu" distribution truck was ambushed on 7 August 2003 by some 50 armed Tamil Tigers' (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE) activists. They torched 5,000 copies of the newspaper after forcing the truck to stop in Sunkankeni, near the eastern town to Batticaloa. "Thinamurasu" ("Daily Drumbeat") is one of the biggest-circulation newspapers in Tamil and often reports on human rights violations, including executions and abductions, by the LTTE in the east and north of the country. The weekly has been the target of threats and attacks for several years. In June, the LTTE leader in the northwestern district of Mannar threatened "Thinamurasu"'s local correspondents with "the worst consequences" if the newspaper continued to be distributed in the region. The newspaper's distributor in eastern Sri Lanka pulled out of his distribution contract in March 2002 after receiving LTTE threats. In May and June 2002, the LTTE banned the paper from circulating in Batticaloa. In November 1999, "Thinamurasu"'s then managing editor Nadarajah Atputharajah, alias "Ramesh", who was also an EPDP parliamentarian, was murdered in Jaffna

*505  $aThe English-language newspaper's publishing licence was cancelled on 12 July 2003, but this decision was struck down on appeal during the week of 8 September, and the National Press Council said the paper could resume publishing. However, the "Khartoum Monitor" did not publish on 13 September, following pressure from Mohammed Farid Hassan, the government prosecutor in charge of subversion. Hassan blocked the paper's publication under Article 130 (paragraphs 1 and 3) of the code of criminal procedure, until the investigation of the case is complete. The "Khartoum Monitor" was suspended in July for running a supposedly illegal interview in 2002 with a former cabinet minister from the country's south who strongly criticised the government. A day earlier, the paper had published its first issue following a previous two-month suspension. It was found guilty in May of inciting religious discord and hatred of the state and was fined 500,000 Sudanese pounds (approx. US Dollars 1,925; 1,700 euros). The authorities seized copies of the paper at the printers on 9 March. State security police summoned publisher Nhial Bol and Terso for questioning later the same day. On 10 March, the police said the issue was seized because of an article by Terso that said the history of Islam in Sudan had not always been peaceful. On 16 January, security forces had also seized all copies of the "Khartoum Monitor". The confiscated issue included an article on a government delegation's absence from peace talks with the southern rebels in Machakos, Kenya. The paper was suspended for the seventh time in 2003 on 24 November, this time indefinitely.

In a report published in "As Sahafa" on 28 July, provincial reporter Youssef Al Bashir Musa wrote that more than 10 students heading to a military training camp had been killed in a bus crash on the road from Al-Fashir to Nyala, in the western province of Darfur. The authorities denied the report the same day and arrested Musa in Nyala, where he is based. The next day, they seized all 20,000 copies of the newspaper after they were printed. The confiscation may also have been linked to another report published in "As Sahafa" that same day, concerning mediation efforts between the national government in Khartoum and rebels in the west of the country. On 8 February, the Sudanese authorities confiscated all copies of the Arabic-language daily "As-Sahafa"'s 9 February issue at the printer's. No explanation was given to editor Nur el Din Madani. However, the paper's 7 February issue had carried an article quoting statements by the Popular National Congress (PNC, Hassan el-Tourabi's banned party) criticising the renewal of the state of emergency.

*505  $aOn July 31 2003, the government canceled the license of the privately owned satirical weekly Al-Domari. The Ministry of Information revoked the paper's license because it had failed to publish within the last three months-a violation of Syria's press law. In April, Al-Domari publisher Ali Farzat ceased publishing under government pressure. He resumed publication in late July when the Ministry of Information informed him that he risked losing his license if the paper remained out of circulation for three consecutive months. Even after a private printer produced the issue, the state-controlled distributor refused to dispense the paper, forcing Al-Domari staff to distribute it on their own. But sources in Syria report that the paper was most likely closed last week because of its aggressive coverage of Syrian political affairs in its latest edition, which was printed in late July after a nearly three-month hiatus. The issue featured articles that criticized the lack of press freedom in Syria, as well as the country's tough new press law.

The newspaper is imported from New Zealand, where it is published. "Times of Tonga" publisher Kalafi Moala said the ban was imposed because of the newspaper's reporting on business activities of members of the island nation's royal family. The kingdom's Supreme Court ruled on 4 April, that the government's earlier bans on the New Zealand-based Tongan-language newspaper "Times of Tonga" were unlawful. The kingdom's Privy Council, which is headed by King Taufa'ahau Tupou, responded by gazetting a "supplement extraordinary ordinance". This, the Privy Council said, was "for the protection of the King, royal family, government and people of this Kingdom from abuse of press freedom."

The journalist also faces charges in five other press-related cases over articles in which he raised the Kurdish question and the army's role in the country's political life, published both in "Idea Politika" and on the Internet site of the same name. Ozkoray faces up to 30 years in prison.

*505  $aThe Zimbabwean government closed the privately-owned newspaper "The Daily News" on 12 September 2003, for failing to register with the Media and Information Commission (MIC) under the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIIPA). Section 66 of the AIPPA stipulates that all media houses must register with the MIC. The ban follows an 11 September Supreme Court ruling that "The Daily News" was operating illegally. On 24 October, the Administrative Court ruled that the state Media and Information Commission (MIC) erred when it rejected a licence application from "The Daily News". The court ordered that a new commission be appointed and a licence granted to the newspaper by 30 November. MIC officials, who argued that the paper submitted its application too late, said they would appeal the ruling. The newspaper had initially refused to apply for a license to protest the new media laws. On 26 October 2003, Washington Sansole, a director of "The Daily News" was arrested, and Tulepi Nkomo, another director's niece was arrested on 25 October. Their arrests, which were preceded by the detention of 18 of the newspaper's employees for several hours on 25 October, are the latest round in an unrelenting government drive to close "The Daily News" for good.

*505  $aCulture and Information Minister Pham Quang Nghi ordered a three month ban on the weekly youth magazine "Sinh Vien Vietnam" on 15 July 2003. The magazine's cover had featured naked human statuettes and, in 2002, displayed a photo-montage of banknotes with an image of late President Ho Chi Minh floating in a toilet bowl. The Culture Ministry said the magazine was suspended under Articles 6 and 10 of the press law for printing "offensive" illustrations. Journalists at the magazine, which is published by the Ho Chi Minh Young Communist Association (linked to the ruling Communist Party), were ordered to engage in public "self-criticism". The ban can be extended by the Party's Culture and Ideology Commission. The magazine's 7 July cover showed a photo of two statuettes of a naked man and woman and the 20 May 2002 issue featured the Ho Chi Minh banknotes.

*505  $a"Nicholas A. Basbanes offers a consideration of the many pressing issues that surround the role of books in contemporary society, such as the willful destruction of books and libraries in Sarajevo, Tibet, and Cambodia, and the spirited efforts to restore them. The matter of "discards" at various libraries takes on an entirely new dimension as well, with fully researched stories about the kind of attitudes that may lead to the loss of "last copies" of important works." "In vivid detail, Basbanes examines the many materials that have been used over the centuries to record information - among them clay tablets, papyrus scrolls, slabs of stone, palm leaves, animal skins, and hammered sheets of gold and copper. Also discussed are the various debates that continue to rage about preservation, which may mean saving and storing books on paper indefinitely, or as electronic data, which are by nature ephemeral."--BOOK JACKET.

From pornography and censorship to the idiocies of accreditation; from feminist scholarship to the rhetoric of the digital divide; from faculty status for librarians to developments in electronic scholarship; from information warfare to the role of the American Library Association, this book is an engaging tour of "Libraryland." Pulp Friction is ideal for professional librarians, library science faculty, library users, and all those who care about the nature and role of the library in contemporary society."--BOOK JACKET.
