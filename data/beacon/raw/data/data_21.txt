*505  $aThe ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has reinvigorated protests across the Arab region, resulting in clashes between security forces and protesters in Algeria, Bahrain, Iran and
Yemen, report the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Human Rights Watch and IFEX members in the region. In Algeria, security forces prevented journalists from covering anti-government protests in
major Algerian cities on 12 February. Kamel Amarni, secretary-general of the Algerian National Syndicate, told CPJ that security forces stopped and searched several journalists before confiscating
their equipment. Internet service was shut down for several hours on the day and Facebook accounts deleted across the country.

popularly known as the "Red Shirts". During the political crisis, 91 people died, including two journalists, and 400,000 websites were blocked. While the emergency decree was lifted in December, there
are still questions about whether the media will be able to operate freely in the post-conflict period, says SEAPA.

commission of a crime or an act that creates "serious turmoil in society" through public speech, writings, drawings or audio-visual telecommunication. It does not require the alleged incitement to be
successful for penalties to be imposed, which include prison terms of six months to five years plus fines.

Assembly and is expected to come into force once Chávez signs it into law. The amendment limits access to websites if they disseminate content that incites violence against the President, and bans
media from producing messages that may constitute "media manipulations aimed at promoting confusion among citizens or at altering the public order" or those that "ignore the authorities." It also bans
messages that could "be contrary to the nation's security."

Laredo's newspaper "El Mañana", with bullet marks still on the wall when reporter Jaime Orozco was shot in the back and paralysed. Now, journalists work under the slogan, "No story is worth dying
for." The documentary, in Spanish with English subtitles (using Google's closed captioning feature), is just one of a series of videos highlighting IAPA's international campaign to end impunity.

*505  $aBolivia's just-passed law against racism and discrimination has spawned a new outbreak of journalist protests. Bolivia's National Press Association (ANP), an IFEX interim member, argues that
the law threatens press freedom and imposes censorship because it gives the government the power to shut down media outlets or throw journalists in jail simply for writing about racism. Article 16
says that "any media outlet that endorses or publishes racist or discriminatory ideas will be liable to economic sanctions and the suspension of its operating licence."

Pakistan. The President's party took matters into its own hands and shut down media outlets carrying the story in Pakistan. Operators in Karachi were torched by PPP activists, backed by a contingent
of police, after operators refused to shut down transmissions of GEO TV and ARY News. After armed PPP activists attacked the Reno Cable Network offices in Karachi and assaulted its staff, the cable
operator was forced to block its transmissions. PPP activists stole and burned copies of the GEO-associated "Jang" and "The News" newspapers in Karachi and other parts of the country, and threats were
issued that delivery vans would be incinerated. On 10 August, newspapers continued to be burned, and one delivery van driver was assaulted.

phones) that are being used to connect to the Internet - which allows the government to control online access.

after the 2006 coup that ousted then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Since April, 2,200 websites have been shut down for violating the Computer Crimes Act, which was also set up to protect the
royal family. ARTICLE 19 and Index on Censorship report that in January, the Senate had "set up an extraordinary committee to oversee the blocking of further sites, warning that over 10,000 could be

Six stations refused to air the speeches, including RCTV Internacional, the most popular station in Venezuela, report the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and other IFEX members. The director of CONATEL then told cable television operators that if they did not stop broadcasting RCTV they would face sanctions, says IPYS. RCTV is known for its critical coverage of the President and his government.
