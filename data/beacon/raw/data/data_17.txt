Ayude was told by an unidentified informant on 15 February that his e-mails were being spied on. As proof, the individual showed him a printout containing the journalist's e-mail password and two messages, one sent to an opposition city councillor and the other to a former councillor responsible for budgetary questions. A colleague at "La Arena", Leonardo Santestebán, confirmed that the Santa Rosa mayor has been putting pressure on journalists and the political opposition. He added that the daily's website was targeted by hackers at the end of January.

Just hours after the report was issued, Yang Le, the head of the Beijing Information Office, which is in charge of Internet control, circulated an order to websites and ISPs asking them to update their lists of banned key-words. The new banned key-words, mostly relating to the Internet, were used throughout the Reporters Without Borders/Chinese Human Rights Defenders report.

Al-Saqaf said officials with the service provider, run by the Ministry of Telecommunications, could not explain why his site was unavailable but denied deliberately blocking access.

*505  $aThe Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) expresses its concern about the persistent measures taken by the Bahraini authorities to block the flow of information by preventing access to websites and popular online forums. The Bahraini authorities have often banned citizens from certain websites which cover "subversive" or controversial topics, such as: public lands misappropriation, administrative and financial corruption, or official discrimination and favouritism. After the exposure of what is locally dubbed the "Bandergate report", the total number of blocked sites, local and international, exceeded 26. Blocked sites encompass sites run by Bahrainis and by non-Bahrainis, including those of local forums (public or belonging to villages), popular committees, political organizations, human rights organizations, religious and non-religious groupings, nationalists, electronic newspapers, news and advertisements sites, and even humour sites.

*505  $aRSF is outraged by a Distributed Denial of Service attack on the US-based Chinese news website Boxun that was probably organised by hackers based in China. Some 2,000 blogs hosted on the site are down. Boxun editor Wei Shi told RSF: "We have never before experienced such a DDOS attack, which consists of bombarding the site with an almost infinite number of connection requests. Our http://www.boxun.com/blog platform crashed on 24 December 2007. We are not even sure if we will be able to recover all the data and we will have to find a new server."

*505  $aA statement by the Higher Criminal Court on 27 November 2007 affirmed the permanence of the decision to stop publishing news or press comments on the "Al-Bandar report". (For further information on instances of prosecution over articles on the "Al-Bandar report", see IFEX alerts of 22 March and 28 February 2007). The Bahraini Ministry of Information used this ban to activate articles 40 and 71 of the Press Decree Code of 2002, issuing an official order to prevent Internet access (from inside Bahrain) to many Bahraini and non-Bahraini websites that make reference to the report. This ban continues and applies to electronic forums, sites of local political and civic organizations, including religious, secular and ethnic groups based outside Bahrain. It also banned access to websites of human rights organizations BCHR and HAQ (inside Bahrain) as well as the Network of Human Rights Information (HRinfo), outside Bahrain.

The "Freedom Newspaper", which can be accessed outside the boundaries of The Gambia, is accusing the country's telecommunication company, GAMTEL, of blocking the website's IP-address, following a story it carried about the company. On 9 March, the newspaper reported that due to mismanagement, the state-run GAMTEL was on the brink of total bankruptcy. This is not the first time the "Freedom Newspaper" has been attacked by the Gambian authorities. On 22 May 2006, the "Freedom Newspaper" and "ALL Gambian" ( http://www.allgambian.net/ ), another online newspaper, were blocked for their criticism of the regime following the hacking of the "Freedom" website.

The magazine's editor said the cover, which showed President Ali Abdallah Al-Saleh, was deemed to be disrespectful to the president.

*505  $aInternet users in Thailand reported sporadic blocking of popular websites on 11 April 2007, as the country's Ministry of Information Communication and Technology (MICT) widened its efforts to limit access to websites with content deemed insulting to the monarchy and threatening to national security. One week after ordering a ban on the popular video-sharing website YouTube (see IFEX alerts of 12 and 4 April 2007), some web surfers in Thailand, including contacts and staff members of SEAPA, on 11 April intermittently found official MICT "blocked-page announcements" diverting access from such sites as Google.com, Amazon.com, and the start page of Blogspot.com. Most complaints received by SEAPA - which were exclusively from subscribers of TRUE Corp. broadband Internet, one of the largest providers in Thailand - came in the afternoon and early evening, and access for all the above sites seemed to have returned to normal by that evening. The MICT block page appeared on the screen when some people tried to access the above sites, bearing the same message: that the website being blocked contained "inappropriate" information.

*505  $aResponding to a civil complaint, an Istanbul court recently banned access to the online news source Eksisozluk ( http://www.sourtimes.org ). Adnan Oktar, a self-proclaimed religious sect leader, complained to the court that the online interactive site, where members can add and edit comments on anything, contained defamatory remarks about him. Eyup's third court of first instance reviewed the complaint and ordered Turk Telecom - the main Internet service provider in Turkey - to close the site to public access. Eksisozluk lawyer Basak Purut told reporters that site moderators had already removed the articles in question but Turk Telecom carried out the court order a day before notice of the order reached them. He appealed the order and the ban was lifted on 19 April 2007. Access to another news website, http://www.Superpoligon.com, was also restricted following Oktar's complaint. Another website, http://www.antoloji.com, which features poetry, has also been blocked, but site moderator Cengiz Ekrem Teymur says they have not received notice from authorities on why the action has been taken. In a separate case, the popular video-sharing site Youtube was blocked in March following a court order after it hosted a video deemed "insulting to Ataturk", founder of modern Turkey (see IFEX alert of 9 March 2007).

Websites blocked include the September 19 Network ( http://www.19sep.net and http://www.19sep.org ) and websites known to be supportive of Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai party, such as the online telecast of PTV television ( http://www.ptvthai.com ), the online broadcast of Saturday Voice ( http://www.saturdaylive.org and http://saturdayvoice.no-ip.info ) and the online broadcast of FM 87.75 Taxi Community Radio ( http://www.shinawatradio.com ). Hosts of popular political blogs used among cyber critics and dissidents, such as BlogSpot ( http://www.blogspot.com ), have also been blocked by some ISPs. The MICT has also blocked anonymous proxy servers through which Thai internet users can access a blocked webpage. The ministry has requested Google Thailand ( http://www.google.co.th ) and Google.com to block access to its cached web pages in Thailand by which blocked pages can be accessed, as well as to block by keyword search.

The ISP failed to respond to several calls made to it by the worldwide press freedom organisation, but a European journalist reported that the firm's press officer said it was due to a "technical problem." Users of the smaller privately-owned ISPs Wana and Méditel are still able to access YouTube, which may have been blocked by Maroc Telecom after videos were posted on it of independence demonstrations for Western Sahara.

*505  $aThe al-Shora website, which regularly posted opposition articles, was closed on 24 February 2007. It was finally allowed to reopen on 23 May. The socialist website aleshteraki was similarly closed for a week, from 16 to 23 May. The government was worried by the fact that they were controlled by opposition parties. It was also concerned about their coverage of the fighting with the al-Houthi rebels in Saada province.

The ministry nonetheless said that the authorities could offer such services. SMS messages expressing criticism of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's government had circulated in the weeks prior to the ban. The opposition parties denied being behind them. On 7 June, the government announced the start of a debate about a new press law, one concerning new media in particular.

This came after the Chinese government blocked access to Israeli literary website http://www.shvoong.com for its 20,000 Chinese users in early July 2007. Lu Yang's forum, "Zhongguo Dangdai Shige Luntan" ("Forum of contemporary Chinese poetry") was removed from its host server Lequyuan (The pleasure garden) at the request of the Information Bureau on 11 July. Two other forums run by Lu Yang have also been closed. Radio Free Asia (RFA) questioned a Lequyuan employee who confirmed that the order came from the authorities and explained, with surprising candour, the mechanism for censoring websites in China.

CERIGUA does not know who is behind the attack. The organisation has not been subject to any direct hostile actions by the government.

*505  $aRecently the Internet in China suffered a crackdown in advance of the 17th Communist Party Congress. The Congress, which is held every five years, is set to begin in Beijing on October 15. In recent weeks, authorities have intensified efforts to control the media, particularly online news and discussion forums. In an unprecedented move, public security officers in various regions have ordered entire Internet Data Centers (IDCs) to close. IDCs physically house servers, often several at a time, which in turn host hundreds and sometimes thousands of Web sites each. According to widespread reports from the media and industry insiders, entire IDCs have been shut down if they host a single Web site that posts information that the government deems offensive. Waigaoqiao, one of China's largest IDCs based in Shanghai, was ordered to close on September 3, effectively shutting 30 servers at once, according to numerous reports from bloggers and industry insiders. Police turned off 1,000 computers housing servers run by Lanmang Internet Co, after they discovered blogs on the network that contained "illegal information."
Authorities have carried out inspections and issued warnings to other IDCs throughout the country. The Public Security Bureau has ordered IDCs to close all interactive functions on Web sites that they host until the Party Congress has concluded, including Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), blogs, and comment sections.

*505  $aThe Bahraini authorities have taken measures to block access by people in Bahrain to the website of the HAQ movement ( http://www.haaq.org ). The HAQ Movement for Liberties and Democracy is a popular civic organization, established in November 2005, calling for respect for rights and democratization in Bahrain. HAQ and other popular organisations are not registered under the national Civic Organizations Law number 21 of 1989 and the Political Societies Law number 26 of 2005. These laws are believed to have been legislated to impose a legal leash on civic organizations, a suspicion substantiated by the day-to-day practices of the authorities. They are also considered to be in violation of well-known international human rights covenants and charters. Nonetheless, because HAQ, like many other popular organizations, is not registered under these laws, the authorities consider it to be illegal, and therefore a target for censorship and repression.

*505  $aActs of Internet censorship by the Bahraini authorities are common. In 2007, BCHR was aware of over 26 blocked websites, local and international. These blockages were mainly in reaction to online reporting about political scandals in Bahrain, especially what was locally dubbed the "Bandergate report" about the misappropriation of public lands, administrative and financial corruption, discrimination and favoritism. Blocked sites included: 1. Six forums belonging to some villages in Bahrain ( http://www.juffair.com/vb , http://www.tubli.net , http://www.karzakan.com , http://alduraz.net/xforum , http://www.eskanaali.com , http://www.shahrakkan.org ); 2. Four general forums ( http://www.bahrainonline.org , http://www.montadayat.org , http://www.ahraralbahrain.com , http://www.wattani.net ); 3. Two sites of civic organizations and popular committees ( http://www.bhteachers.org /phpBB2/ , http://www.shaheedbh.com ); 4. The sites of two political organisations and movements ( http://www.vob.org  and http://www.aldemokrati.org ); 5. The sites of two human rights organizations ( http://www.bahrainrights.org , http://www.hrinfo.net ); 6. The sites of two religious groups (Copts, Arab Christians:

One humour site ( http://www.bahraintimes.org); 12. One blog ( http://www.Mahood.tv ). Censorship of these sites was made on the basis of the notorious Press Decree Code No. 47 of 2002. Over 14 Bahraini journalists have been interrogated, prosecuted, or taken to trial based on this law.

The authorities deny being behind the blockages but the shutdown fits the earlier profile of such blocking by government. The closures of these websites have been linked to their publication of transcripts of telephone conversations alleged to involve senior government officials.

*505  $aSources in Rangoon are reporting problems accessing the Internet in recent days. Exiled Burmese are also reportedly having a more difficult time than usual in calling into the country. Slower or unreliable Internet connections and the abnormal telecommunications problems coincide with what has now been a five-day mission into Burma by United Nations Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari. Sources said they have been having problems getting online since Gambari arrived in Rangoon last week. Web-based e-mail services such as Gmail, and voice over IP (VOIP) services such as GTalk and Skype, are technically banned in Burma, but remain popular as Internet-savvy Burmese use proxy servers and other technical strategies to get around government firewalls. In recent days, however, getting online itself has become problematic, SEAPA's sources inside the country say. The military government has been restricting and even suspending Internet access - for which state-connected corporations have a monopoly - since the eruption of widespread protests and a harsh government crackdown on activists, students, and religious leaders in September 2007.

*505  $aCuban Internet users face impediments when seeking access to blogs on the http://www.desdecuba.com platform that hosts, among others, one of the most popular blogs in the country, "Generación Y", run by Yoani Sánchez. The platform has been inaccessible from public connection points in cybercafés and hotels since 20 March 2008. The few private connections, used for professional reasons or in secret, take at least 20 minutes to download the homepage of the site. Editing and moderating posts has become impossible. Desdecuba.com hosts an online magazine, "Consenso", and six blogs, including "Generación Y" ( http://www.desdecuba.com/generaciony ), created in April 2007 by Yoani Sánchez and regularly visited by large numbers of Cubans. More than one million Internet users visited the young blogger's page in February 2008. There have also been difficulties accessing http://www.cu.clasificados.com and http://www.revolico.net , both of which post classified ads. The public company ETECSA, Cuba's sole access provider, has not offered any explanation.
