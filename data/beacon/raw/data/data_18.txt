The incident occurred only hours after individuals who had been presumed to be gang members robbed the two electricity meters in an effort to cut off power to the newspaper's facilities. The newspaper had recently denounced that individuals alleged to be state ministry police (Policías Ministeriales) had "confiscated" all copies of the newspaper already on the newsstands and at street crossings. In its electronic edition, "El Cinco" indicated the attacks were in retaliation for articles in which it had criticised the state government. The newspaper commented that the copies of the issue that it did manage to get to the stands after the abduction were bought from the vendors for more than the asking price, in order to prevent the issue from reaching the public.

Since it was too late to replace the missing page, the editors decided not to print the newspaper. The security forces also asked "Ajras Al-Huriyya"'s staff to sign a previously-drafted statement undertaking not to published the censored content online or elsewhere. Such last-minute raids and the signing of previously-drafted undertakings are the new methods being used to prevent newspapers from appearing since censorship was illegally re-introduced on 6 February.

Documents were seized with the aim of establishing who leaked the information for a 10 February report in the newspaper that the state government's treasurer (finance minister), Eric Ripper, had proposed that 10 million euros be allocated to "strategic advertising campaigns." The article claimed that the money was to be used to finance the reelection campaign of the state's Labour Party government, led by Alan Carpenter.

*505  $aDistribution of the 27 April 2008 edition of the weekly magazine "Proceso" was deliberately impeded through the mass purchasing of copies, between 27 April and 1 May, before they reached the public. The issue bore on its cover a picture of Sonora state governor Eduardo Bours under the headline "Drug power in Sonora", and contained a report on governor's wealth, his abuse of power to benefit his family's businesses, and the possible involvement of these businesses in drug-trafficking and money laundering."Proceso" reports that individuals identifying themselves as government employees purchased 3530 copies of the edition directly from the company responsible for its distribution. A few copies that somehow made it to local newsstands were also quickly purchased en masse before ordinary members of the public could buy individual copies. In January 2007, an edition of the magazine "Contralínea" was seized by Sonoran authorities because of an article alleging similar misconduct by the same governor. In October 2007, in Guanajuato state, there was a similar mass purchasing of an edition of "Proceso" that carried a report on the business dealings of former president Fox's in-laws, the Bribiesca family.

*505  $aThe English-Khmer newspaper "Cambodia Daily" has had to stop publishing a pullout on Burma after authorities confiscated that section for two consecutive days, warning that a suspension would soon follow.
"Cambodia Daily" started the pullout, called the "Burma Daily", on 16 May 2008, "to introduce to the Burmese people what a free and responsible newspaper looks like", its publisher Bernard Krisher was quoted as saying by the press. However, the Information Ministry said the pullout, which had the same masthead as the main paper except for the title, required a separate licence and ordered its confiscation on 19 May. Police continued to seize the pullout from newsstands the following day as Information Minister Khieu Kanharith said the publication could harm relations between Cambodia and Burma. "Cambodia Daily" was later threatened with an immediate 30-day suspension, said the Cambodian Association for the Protection of Journalists (CAPJ), a SEAPA partner, which issued a statement on 21 May deploring the seizure. Vendors said some officers even took the whole paper away, according to press reports.

After pointing a revolver at him, they threw him to the ground and beat him, ordering him to stop circulating his magazine in the city of Honda, in Tolima department. The incident took place downtown, half a block from a mobile police station, immediately after the government-appointed bodyguards who have been protecting him for several months left him temporarily. Due to the incident, "La Verdad" was not distributed in Honda. In a special insert in "La Verdad"'s most recent edition, Cárdenas had reported on the alleged ties and business dealings of various current and former Honda city councillors with "El Costeño", the commander of the Omar Izasa front of Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia del Magdalena Medio, a paramilitary group operating in the valley surrounding the middle section of the Magdalena River, which courses through central Colombia to the Caribbean coast.

the Kirov District Court in the regional capital of Ufa, in the central Russian Republic of Bashkortostan, convicted and sentenced Viktor Shmakov,editor-in-chief of the independent newspaper Provintsialnye Vesti (Provincial News), and contributing writer Airat Dilmukhametov, according to the official Web site of the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Bashkortostan. The two were convicted of violating the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and breaking laws on media and extremism. Shmakov told CPJ that the Kirov District
Court ordered Provintsialnye Vesti to close in early June at the request of the local prosecutors; authorities claimed the newspaper violated media and extremism legislation by allegedly committing technical violations - such as
failing to send free copies to state agencies and not publishing on a regular basis - and publishing extremist materials. Shmakov told CPJ he will appeal the verdict.

*505  $aA Panamanian civil court on Friday decided to order the seizure of assets belonging to the weekly newspaper El Periódico, as well as portions of two staff members' salaries. The ruling came after the publication ran a story on alleged tax evasion by a local real estate tycoon. Judge María Leticia Cedeño Suira with the Eleventh Civil Court of the First Judicial district in PanamaCity ordered the confiscation of US$1.1 million of El Periódico's assets, according to local news reports. The seizure included the premises of Editora Gráfica del Pacífico, S.A., the company that owns the weekly, El Periódico's bank accounts, and 15 percent of the wages of Omar Wong, the paper's director, and one of its journalists, according to the daily La Prensa. The judge's decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Panamanian real state mogul Herman Bern after Panama City-based El Peródico published an investigative piece on September 1, titled "Pobre Millonario" (Poor Millionaire), which included a copy of Bern's 2007 tax return. El Periódico said it had obtained Bern's tax filings
through an anonymous reader.
