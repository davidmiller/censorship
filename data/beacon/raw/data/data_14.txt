*505  $aAnecdotal evidence (some anecdote! a look at what is brushed off as merely anecdotal evidence) -- Hope and pride (a look at the dream that nuclear technology could be of great benefit to humankind, and how I was proud to participate in a nuclear project until I learned better) -- Oh, what happened to us! (suppressed and persecuted truth-tellers: also includes an account of how I was pressured to approve a design which could kill people and cause extensive property damage, with a long list of how this depravity happens in industry, particularly in the nuclear industry) -- Is Murphy's law legal? (you be the judge : starts out with how I was nearly killed by a mishap, develops mishaps throughout the ages, leading up to nuclear Murphyisms) -- Apple pie (like mother never baked : rather than nuclear power being safer than mom's apple pie, it is a concoction of scientists who are bad apples : parades a list of bad-apple pies from the chemical industry, the tobacco industry, and the nuclear industry) -- Sunshine effects (not heartwarming : global warming is strongly indicated by hard-to-deny evidence) -- Nuclear power, the only answer (answered : extensive description of cleaner, safer, less costly alternatives which have been crushed) -- The wind stops blowing (a new law of physics : many examples of violations of elementary physics by nuclear liars : one is that the wind stops blowing when you have a nuclear accident, explained simply) -- The great uranium shell game (brazen fraud : there isn't enough fissionable uranium for a greatly expanded nuclear program without going to the plutonium reactor, which poses hideous problems : exposes shenanigans) -- Really how much energy from nukes? (very low net yield : explains how easy it is to deduce this shocking result using elementary analysis : this chapter crunches key official summary numbers to reveal the implications of the great uranium shell game) -- Nobody, but nobody died at Three Mile Island! (holocaust denied) -- Scientists on the march (covers the use of nuclear waste as a fertilizer, depleted uranium, food irradiation, etc.) -- Cleaner than coal (debunks the fraudulent claim that nuclear is cleaner than coal : it isn't even cleaner than the dirtiest coal-burning operation when non-discussed factors are considered) -- Why not make nuclear plants safe? (basics of why : it can't be, not ever) -- Your rights (rights denied) -- Sabotaging our security blankets (treason) -- Unfair favoritism (unlimited rip-off : explains how favoritism for non-renewable energy gets much more than 300 times the government support that renewable sources get) 
*520  $aThe point of Indian Point (look at this poster child of the industry) -- We carefully plan the transportation of nuclear poisons (the three stooges still live : shocking evidence of absolute non-care) -- What about civil liberties? (forget them : nuclear technologies destroy civil liberties) -- Spaced out (nukes over our heads : astronomical risks and costs -- It's a free press (theoretically : examples of distortion and censorship) -- Alara (as low as reasonably achievable : who decides "reasonably"?) -- Rules of research (ignored basics : an abstract of Dr. John Gofman's guidelines) -- By executive order (there Reagan went again : a little known edict by Reagan which proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that every nuke is a bomb-making machine, along with other info) -- They want to do it again! (repeating mistakes : the insanity of pushing forward with nukes again, and the faults of the latest generation of design) -- Denial is not a river in Egypt (the psychology of denial by nuclear folks, and the compulsive folly)

Steps were taken to deprive the army of its strong political hold. The establishment of new political parties was permitted. Censorship was abolished. Political Islam began to make itself heard." "Nevertheless, the Reform Era which started in May 1998 did not bring the 'complete reform' demanded by student protestors. The burdens inherited from the Soeharto era proved heavy, and animosities between various ethnic and religious groups, even within the Islamic community, continued to characterize political and social life. Violent political confrontations and mass protests continued. Communal violence took on unprecedented forms." "This book traces recent developments in Indonesia, opening with the explosion of violence in the run-up to the general election of May 1997, and ending with developments in November and December 2000. This was a time when, to escape imprisonment, Soeharto's son Tommy went missing and Indonesia entered a new phase of political insecurity as support for its president, Abdurrahman Wahid, waned."--BOOK JACKET.

The best-selling Hit List series gives you the information you need to defend challenged books with an informed response, all the while ensuring free access to young book lovers." "Featuring more than three dozen "hot button" books, Hit List for Children 2 presents a who's who of children's literature writers including Dahl, Allard, Blume, Rowling, Stine, L'Engle, Lowry, and Naylor. With a profile of each book that includes its plot, characters, published reviews, awards and prizes, and author resources, you will be prepared to answer even the toughest attacks. The most recent and compelling challenges are also discussed so that you will be prepared to address specific points."--BOOK JACKET.

In this visionary, interdisciplinary approach to Internet governance, five critical conflicts between freedom and control are examined: fair competition and open access, free expression, intellectual property, privacy rights, and security." "With the exception of certain circumstances, self-regulation is not only viable, but is a highly favored alternative to the forced uniformity of centralized control structures. This book examines the emerging body of law and public policy attempting to control the anarchy of cyberspace. Internet selfregulation is defended with the assertion that the same powerful and flexible architectures that created the Internet can aid the private sector in decentralizing its regulation."--BOOK JACKET.

Most obviously, employees need protection when speaking about immediate threats to health and safety or serious financial malpractice, but they also need protection when participating in debate on matters that are in the public interest. This book suggests that the rights of employees to participate in debate on matters of public interest are vital to a healthy democratic system."--BOOK JACKET.

"This fourth edition has been completely revised and updated to emphasise general principles and current controversial problems. Developments since the last edition include substantial case law under the Human Rights Act 1998, the embedding in the constitution of the 'Nolan' standards of public life, partial House of Lords reform, the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2001. There is also a continuing debate about the relationship between the civil service and politicians and more broadly between Parliament and the executive that affects the foundations of the constitution itself. There has been developing literature on fundamental constitutional values and principles, including the rule of law, sovereignty and accountability."--BOOK JACKET.

*520  $a"In light of recent frustrations with the press over its increasingly sensationalistic coverage of the news, no liberty may be more vulnerable to the vagaries of the current political climate than the freedom of the press. By considering public opinion data from two original surveys (in 1997 and 1999) on free press rights against the backdrop of modern First Amendment jurisprudence, the authors offer new and original insights into the nature of popular support for these rights. Their findings are as comforting as they are counterintuitive: Public support for the constitutional right to a free press remains as strong as ever, even as its most visible practitioners find themselves increasingly under siege." "In offering this argument, Yalof and Dautrich stake a position in an age-old debate over the true value and worth of public opinion. Their findings endorse the notion of a "rational" public as well as the strength of press freedoms in our society."--BOOK JACKET.

*503  $aThe Afghan independent newspaper Kabul Weekly hit the streets of the capital on January 24, 2002, after an absence of more than five years. It was the first independent news weekly to be published in Kabul since the departure of the Taliban. The weekly, which includes seven pages in Pashto and Dari and three pages in French and English, had an initial print run of 2,500 copies, and was priced at 2,000 Afghanis (the price of a loaf of bread). It was published with the permission of the Ministry of Information.

*503  $aIn November 2002, the daily "Koha Jonë" became the target of government pressure and intimidation following publication of articles critical of Prime Minister Fatos Nano. Days after the newspaper published the critical commentaries, at least five different government agencies sent inspectors to check its parent media company's compliance with financial, labor and other regulations. While the inspections may be lawful on their face, their timing, unusual nature and surrounding circumstances raise strong suspicions they are being used to retaliate against the newspaper. The inspectors have seized possession of all financial documentation of the "Koha" media group - which includes two dailies, one television station, and one radio station - making it difficult for the group to conduct everyday transactions.

*503  $aThe newspaper was sued for defamation due to the article "Deputy Prosecutor of Nasimi District Works for NSM?", published on 21 July 2001. The article accused the Deputy Prosecutor Tofiq Alioglu Kerimov of being incompetent and having as a result been transferred from the Prosecutor's office to the department of observation of traffic regulations. The Yasamal District Court on 1 October 2001 ruled against the newspaper and imposed its closure and a fine of 100 million manat (equivalent to the media outlet's three-monthly turnover), on the basis of Article 19 of the Mass Media law and Article 23 of the Civil Code. The newspaper in turn started a legal action against Mr Kerimov, which was heard by the Court of Appeal on 6 December 2001, claiming that the legal suit had damaged its business reputation. However, the Court of Appeal found the appeal groundless and upheld the decision of the Yasamal District Court to impose a fine and close the newspaper.

*503  $aOn 29 July, Baku's Yasamalsky District Court found Huseynov and Eynulla Fetullayev, a reporter for "Monitor", guilty of defamation and ordered them to pay a fine of 50 million manats (US dollar 10,200) and publish a retraction of the article. "Monitor"'s recent troubles began directly after the magazine's 6 April launch. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry sued "Monitor" for defamation after the magazine published a critical first-person account by Fetullayev about his experience in the military in the magazine's inaugural issue. In addition, immediately following the release of its first edition, "Monitor" was unable to print subsequent issues because the state printing house Azerbaijan, as well as private printers Ekspress, CBS, and BPP, refused to print the magazine. "Monitor" was founded in 1996 and was closed down in 1998 after authorities confiscated copies of the magazine from Baku vendors and sued Huseynov for defaming the Azeri people.Huseynov lost the lawsuit, and the publication was suspended. Two years later, the magazine resumed publishing under the name "Monitor Weekly", and Justice Ministry officials threatened to close it unless Huseynov published an apology for allegedly misleading statements contained in the 1998 "Monitor" article. On 23 April 2000, tax inspectors closed down the printing company where the magazine was produced and later allowed it to reopen on the condition that it cease printing "Monitor Weekly". On 7 May 2000, tax inspectors sealed the magazine's Baku offices for alleged tax violations, although they did not provide any evidence to support the accusations. Later that month, in response to the complaint of a private company that accused the magazine of "propagating false information," Azerbaijan's Economic Court suspended publication of "Monitor Weekly" and froze its assets. On 4 September 2000, Huseynov was informed that the court had revoked "Monitor Weekly"'s license and the magazine was forced to suspend publication. In September 2001, another one of Huseynov's publications, independent weekly newspaper "Bakinsky Bulvar", was closed after Baku mayor Hajibala Abutalibov won a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper. Abutalibov sued "Bakinsky Bulvar" after it published an article criticizing the mayor. Following the newspaper's closure, the court launched criminal proceedings against Huseynov for defaming the mayor and sentenced him to six months in prison. Huseynov served almost a month of his term when he was released by a presidential pardon in honor of the 10th anniversary of Azerbaijan's independence.

*503  $aIn the autumn of 2002, several newspapers were being sued by high-ranking state officials and kiosks operated by private media distribution companies were being removed. Certain newspapers, including the Caucasus region's biggest daily, "Yeni Musavat", was unfairly targeted for prosecution by the Ministry of Defence and two former heads of the State Property Committee, Nadir Nasibov and Barat Nuriyev, who wanted the newspaper banned for three years. The Ministry of Defence wanted the newspaper to be punished and opened a criminal investigation against several journalists from the newspaper. "Yeni Musavat" was accused of insulting the "honour and dignity" of the ministry in its reports about a riot at the High Military School. Former heads of the State Property Committee also sued the newspaper for insulting their "honour and dignity".

*503  $aThe government of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia banned the 4 April edition of the Hong Kong-based weekly "Far Eastern Economic Review". The cover story of the edition, "Bangladesh: Cocoon of Terror," described the country as besieged by "Islamic fundamentalism, religious intolerance, militant Muslim groups with links to international terrorist groups, a powerful military with ties to the militants, the mushrooming of Islamic schools churning out radical students, middle-class apathy, poverty and lawlessness." In response, the Information Ministry called the article a "malicious report" that would "create hatred and division among the people of Bangladesh." On 3 April, the ministry declared the publication, sale, reprinting, and preservation of the magazine to be illegal, according to Bangladeshi and international news reports.

*503  $aOn 5 July 2002, the government withdrew the publishing licence of the local newspaper "Dainik Uttarabanga Barta", published in Natore (northern Bangladesh). The authorities criticised the newspaper for publishing an article on 26 March, the day of the country's independence, which incorrectly identified Prime Minister Khaleda Zia as the opposition leader and opposition leader Sheikh Hasina as prime minister. Hanif Ali Sheikh, the newspaper's managing director and a local leader of the Awami League (opposition party), said that it was simply a mistake caused by incorrect data processing. He apologised for the error and published an erratum the following day on the newspaper's front page. Local officials filed charges against the publication despite the correction. After Sheikh gave his explanation, the local administration decided not to withdraw the newspaper's license. Three months later, following an injunction from the government in Dhaka, the local administration withdrew the newspaper's licence, in accordance with article 20(D) of the 1973 press law.

*503  $aOn 7 February 2002, the Bangladeshi government prohibited the distribution of the 11 February issue of the American magazine "Newsweek". Police confiscated copies of the magazine that had arrived in the country. According to a statement issued by the Press Information Department, the decision followed the publication of a photograph of a Turkish manuscript depicting the prophet Mohammed with the angel Gabriel. The photograph was included as part of a comparative feature on Islam and Christianity. The authorities felt that this representation of Mohammed was likely to "shock devout persons." Previously, in September 2000, an issue of "Newsweek" that included an article on Islam was banned in Bangladesh. In Indonesia, the distribution company PT Indoprom decided to stop circulation of the same issue of "Newsweek" in the country. According to a PT Indoprom manager questioned by the daily newspaper "Jakarta Post", the decision was taken after consulting the Indonesian Council of Ulemas. 10,000 "Newsweek" subscribers in the country are to receive a note informing them that the magazine will not be distributed as long as the contents of the article have not been examined by the Ulemas and the National Press Council.

*503  $a16 January 2002, DESA, the company that supplies Dhaka with electricity, cut off power to "Dainik Janakantha"'s printing facility in Dhaka. According to one DESA employee, the order to cut the power "came from the top." For its part, the daily affirms that it was never warned of the power shutdown and had paid its bills. Despite the power outage, "Dainik Janakantha" was printed as usual, thanks to its backup generators. Its management denounced this move as yet another attack by the authorities on the newspaper, which has been criticising government policies under the leadership of Begum Khaleda Zia. The government stopped buying advertising space in "Dainik Janakantha" on 22 November. This followed the publication of articles about the harsh abuse allegedly perpetrated by members of the ruling party against Hindu minorities and Awami League militants. In an editorial published on the daily's front page, the editorial staff affirmed that this decision came from the highest government level, and not from the Film and Publications Department, which "simply carries out orders." Furthermore, in early January, the government modified its press copy distribution to Bangladesh embassies worldwide. The number of copies of the newspapers "Dainik Janakantha", "Dainik Prothom Alo", "Dainik Jugantor" and "Dainik Sangbad" dispatched by the minister of foreign affairs was considerably reduced. These four publications are known to be critical of the ruling coalition.

The previous day's edition contained an article on the growing power of a Kushtia drug trafficker. The director contacted the police, who disregarded his urgent call. At nightfall, armed men went to the newspaper's office. They padlocked the entrance, then forced their way into the Quality Printing Press, which prints "Andoloner Bazar" and three other newspapers, "Bajropath", "Ajker Alo" and "Bangladesh Barta". Printing plates were damaged and workers were threatened with death if they continued printing. As a result, none of the four newspapers appeared the following day. Anti-riot police were deployed outside the printing house and the newspapers' offices the next day, but employees said they fear further reprisals.

*503  $aOn 27 November 2002, the Information Ministry closed the independent "Myestnoye Vremya", which was founded in October and had only published three issues, on the grounds that the newspaper had not legally registered its rental space. WAN and the World Editors Forum are concerned that the closure of "Myestnoye Vremya" was politically motivated after the newspaper announced its decision to establish regional correspondents ahead of next year's local elections. The closure of "Myestnoye Vremya" was the latest act of censorship in an ongoing government campaign to silence critical voices. During the previous three months, three journalists had been sentenced to lengthy prison sentences of hard-labour for "insulting" the president.

These moves followed the jail sentences imposed in June on the editor and a journalist of the Grodno opposition newspaper "Pagonya". On 2 August, journalist Mikhail Podolyak and his newspaper, "Nasha Svoboda", were sentenced to fines of 15 million and 100 million Belarusian rubles (approximately US dollar 8,260 and US dollar 55,100) respectively for libelling Anatoly Tozik, president of the State Control Committee. On 1 August, the day before the trial started, authorities seized "Nasha Svoboda"'s computers. Meanwhile, "Rabochy" editor Viktor Ivaskevich faced a possible five-year jail sentence for allegedly defaming President Alexander Lukashenko under Article 367/2 of the penal code in an article that appeared in a special elections issue in summer 2001. As a result of the article, entitled "A thief belongs in prison", 40,000 copies of the special issue were confiscated.

*503  $aThe Literary Scrutiny Board (censorship bureau) banned the publication of the magazines "Living Color", "Mhyar Nat Maung Mingalar" and "Kyi pwar yee" during the month of June 2002. According to the independent monthly "Irrawaddy", the business magazine "Living Color" was punished for having published an advertisement of the MK Billiard Company. The company is reportedly in conflict with the military junta's Ministry of Sport because it refused to give equipment to the official billiards association. Founded in 1995, "Living Color", whose managing editor is the son of Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, had never been penalised before. In addition, the Literary Scrutiny Board banned "Kyi pwar yee" for using the word "Yodaya" (the former name for Thailand) in its latest issue. On 22 May, the Literary Scrutiny Board told publishers of private publications in Rangoon that they were forbidden from publishing articles or advertisements concerning Thailand. Finally, the magazine "Mhyar Nat Maung Mingalar" was banned for publishing an advertisement on a page of the magazine that is usually reserved for SPDC propaganda. The magazine, published since 1991, focuses on women's news and short stories.

The government's Literary Scrutiny Board banned the publication for articles referring to Thailand and Thai advertising in privately-owned media.

The ban stemmed from a diplomatic and military crisis between the two countries that led to the closing of their common borders at Mae Sai, Mae Sot and Ranong. Since the reopening of the border on 15 October, relations between the two countries have begun to return to normal. However, the advertising ban continues, financially threatening the privately-owned media, which obtain most of their advertising revenue from Thai firms.

An article published that morning in "Tassouman" reported on the theft of Interior Minister Emile Boga Doudou's vehicle. At about noon on 9 September in Abidjan, uniformed police officers burst into the offices of the Mayama press group, which publishes the dailies "Le Patriote" and "Tassouman". The newspapers have links to the opposition Rally of Republicans (Rassemblement des républicains, RDR) led by Alassane Dramane Ouattara. The offices were ransacked, tear-gas canisters were thrown and four people received minor injuries. The police officers accused "Tassouman" of publishing an article on the theft of the interior minister's car. The information proved to be incorrect and the editorial staff were preparing to publish a correction: in reality, it was the minister of solidarity and health's vehicle that had been stolen. The interior minister released a communiqué stating that he was in no way involved in this case.

*503  $aThe satirical weekly "Feral Tribune"'s bank account was frozen on 1 March 2002 following the Zagreb Regional Court's sentencing of the weekly to fines amounting to 200,000 kuna (approx. US dollars 23,900; 27,183 euros). The newspaper was sentenced for "moral damage" and publishing "cosmopolitan opinions and views". The freezing of the "Feral Tribune"'s bank account and heavy fines against it threatened its ability to continue publishing. The first sentence was based on a 1995 article by art historian Zvonko Makovic, in which he analysed Marica Mestrovic's incompetence in her management of the Mestrovic Foundation. While the author's analysis was considered an acceptable form of public criticism, the magazine was heavily fined for publishing his article. The second sentence against the weekly is based on a 1993 article by Viktor Ivancic, who criticised anti-Semitic and pro-fascist remarks by Zeljko Olujic, an attorney with close ties to former president Franjo Tudjman. Olujic is representing Mestrovic. The court upheld the verdict from the first trial, which found Ivancic guilty of having expressed "cosmopolitan opinions and views" and sentenced "Feral Tribune" to pay Olujic substantial damages and interest.

In the story, the newspaper reported that "Kinshasa skirted disaster" on 8 July, in a confrontation between "civilians and soldiers that deteriorated into a violent battle" and led to "four deaths and major material damage" in Kinshasa/Kintambo's Jamaica neighbourhood. Moreover, the entire print-run of "La Tempête des Tropiques"'s 11 July edition (issue 2015) was seized that very morning. National Congolese Police Special Services officers seized all the copies just as they went on sale. The daily's five journalists and employees were released later that same evening, on the condition that the newspaper publish a correction to the offending story in its 12 July edition. "La Tempête des Tropiques" agreed to publish a correction. It appeared on the front page of that day's newspaper, under the headline, "No deaths, but an injured soldier is transferred to [Kinshasa's] general hospital".

*503  $aPublisher Delly Bonsange and publication director Raymond Kabala of the Kinshasa-based newspaper "Alerte-Plus" were sentenced to six and 12 months in prison, respectively, and fined a total of US dollars 300,000 in damages, according to a verdict made public on 6 September 2002 by the Kinshasa/N'djili Tribunal. The two journalists were convicted, respectively, with making "written falsehoods" and "harmful accusations" after publishing information about Security and Public Order Minister Mwenze Kongolo's health. The tribunal also found Kongolo's request for compensation justified, and fined Kabala US dollars 200,000 and Bonsange US dollars 100,000 in damages for harm suffered by the plaintiff. In addition, the enormity of the damages, set at US dollars 300,000, in place of the US dollars 50,000 sought by the plaintiff, is out of proportion with the harm allegedly suffered by the plaintiff. Moreover, this clearly indicates the intention of forever silencing the newspaper "Alerte Plus," which is incapable of paying off such a sum. 
*506  $a"Harmful accusations" is a press offence according to Article 74 of Press Law No. 96-002 of 22 June 1996, which defines a press offence as any infraction committed through the press.

Alfredo López Xicará accused the government official of having threatened to kill him and of physically and verbally attacking him in connection with a territorial boundary dispute. Subsequently, in what constitutes an attack against freedom of expression, Pedro Joel Martínez kept out of circulation 90 per cent of an edition of the biweekly El Quezalteco, in an attempt to keep his treatment of Alfredo López Xicará out of the public eye. The government official approached various reporters and editors-in-chief in order to ensure that no article reporting on his actions would be published. Failing this, he bought 90 per cent of the biweekly's Tuesday 7 May edition.

Iran's Supreme National Security Council, which is headed by President Muhammad Khatami and includes other top government officials, had issued the directive a day earlier, on Wednesday, July 10, and instructed publishers not to take a position "for or against" Taheri.

Shebab relays programmes from other Arab stations, including Al-Jazeera, which were normally inaccessible to Iraqis, since the government banned satellite dishes. "Babel" published a report on 17 November speculating on the fate of the president's family should a war erupt between Iraq and the United States. The newspaper reported that Libya had denied a story in the British daily "The Times" claiming that President Hussein was ready to pay Libya billions of dollars if it gave political asylum to him, his family and top aides.

*503  $aOn 24 December 2002, the interior minister closed the radical Islamic weekly "Sawt al-Haq wa Al-Hurriya" ("Voice of Truth and Freedom") for two years, on grounds that it threatened national security. RSF called on Interior Minister Eli Yishai to reconsider the closure bearing in mind Israeli legal precedent, notably the "'Kol Ha'am' decision", which said a newspaper can only be shut down if it is an "almost certain" danger to national security. The newspaper had 15 days to appeal the 22 December order to close the paper. The order came at the request of the Shin Beth security service, which stated that the paper was the mouthpiece for the Palestinian militant group Hamas. "Sawt al-Haq wa Al-Hurriya" was published by the radical wing of the Islamic Movement in Israel, a party founded in the 1970s that had two seats in the Israeli parliament and controls five Arab towns in Israel. The closure order was based on Article 19 (2a) of the 1933 Press Ordinance dating from the period of the British Mandate in Palestine, before the founding of Israel. It was last used in 1953, when a government order to close two newspapers, "Kol Ha'am" and "Al-Ittihad", was appealed at the High Court. High Court Judge Shimon Agranat made what became known as the "'Kol Ha'am' decision", now considered a cornerstone of freedom of expression in Israel.

*503  $aOn March 3, the State Security Court banned the publication of the March 4 issue of Al-Majd unlss the paper's management agreed to remove two articles about alleged government corruption. One of the articles detailed a large-scale financial scandal. The second article was critical of former internal security chief Samih El-Bateekhi. According to Al-Majd editor Fahd al-Rimawi, the March 4 issue was sent out for printing on Sunday, March 2. The printing of Al-Majd is handled by another local independent newspaper, Al-Rai. Before the paper could be printed, Al-Rai staffers received a fax from the prosecutor general of the State Security Court, ordering them not to print Al-Majd. When al-Rimawi contacted the State Security Court he was told that the paper could only be published if he agreed to remove the two offending articles. (Al-Rimawi believes that the prosecutor was tipped off by someone at Al-Rai.) Under Penal Code amendments passed in 2001, publications can be suspended or permanently banned if they print "false or libelous information that can undermine national unity or the country's reputation," "violate basic social norms," "sow the seeds of hatred," or "harm the honor or reputation of individuals," among numerous other restrictions. Offending journalists face prison sentences of up to six months and fines of 5,000 Jordanian dinars (about US dollars 7,000).

*503  $aOn May 22 2002, assailants threw Molotov cocktails into the office windows of Delovoye Obozreniye Respublika, an opposition newspaper based in the city of Almaty in southern Kazakhstan. In a separate incident, two employees of another opposition paper were attacked the previous day. No one was injured in the attack, but the resulting fire destroyed much of the office, including the publication's technical equipment. Local police are investigating the incident. This was the latest in a series of attacks on Delovoye Obozreniye Respublika. On March 8, Irina Petrushova, the paper's founder and editor-in-chief, received a funeral wreath. And on May 19, according to international reports and journalists in Almaty, the newspaper's staff found a decapitated dog's corpse hanging from an office window with an attached note that read, "There won't be a next time." The following day, Petrushova found the dog's head in the building's yard. On May 21, Bakhytgul Makinbai, a correspondent with the Almaty opposition newspaper SolDat, and Kenzhe Aitpakiyev, a staff member, were assaulted by four assailants who broke into the paper's offices. According to the two victims, the assailants beat them, stole expensive technical equipment, and threatened further attacks if the newspaper continued publishing. Journalists at the newspapers, which are both known for their critical coverage of the Kazakh government, believe these attacks were politically motivated. Respublika was suspended in April for two months, after Kazakhstan's information ministry filed a lawsuit, accusing it of failing to indicate registration data in its issues. Until May 2002, the newspaper had continued to print using copy machines. It has found it almost impossible to find alternative print facilities.

*503  $aOn 24 July 2002, Christopher Mwoki Kyandi, publisher of and journalist with the tabloid "The Truth", was sentenced to nine months in prison for "publishing false news". In early July, "The Truth" published a story describing a sexual event on its front and back pages that caused a commotion in Nairobi. A large number of people descended on the area where the alleged event supposedly took place. Police arrested the publisher and seized 200 copies of the newspaper. In an 11 July court appearance, Kyandi pleaded guilty to writing and spreading a rumour. He was convicted two weeks later and was sent to jail immediately to begin his nine-month sentence.

The London-based Saudi Arabian daily had to obtain authorisation every day before it could export and distribute copies of each issue. This measure, which on 3 and 4 January 2002 caused several hours' delay in the newspaper's distribution, followed the publication of an article on 31 December 2001 about an attempt to assassinate President Lahoud in Monte Carlo. The president's press office denied the information, which it claimed was "entirely fabricated", and the daily formally apologised.

*503  $aOn February 13, 2002, the Monrovia police arrested at least four journalists from the Analyst Newspaper. The director of the publication, Stanley Sankor, and a reporter, James Llody, were among the detained. According to the chief of police, Paul Mulbah, they were arrested because of several articles that were "against peace" and "poisoned the minds of the people". The officer quoted a few headlines published by the newspaper ("Liberians drowning in horrors", "Emergency power pinches businesses", "What rights and freedoms can the President suspend?"), and added that he would pursue "any journalist who tries to subvert the peace". The four men are being held in a cell at the police station in Monrovia. The police has also closed down the premises of the Analyst Newspaper. The Head of State, Charles Taylor, declared the state of emergency on February 8, 2002, after an attack by rebels on the town of Klay, around 40 km north of the capital.

*503  $aMalaysian Deputy Minister of the Interior Chor Chee Heung announced his government's decision to block or delay the distribution of the latest issues of the international magazines "Newsweek", "Far Eastern Economic Review", "The Economist" and "Time". The minister explained that the measure followed the magazines' publication of "erroneous news about the situation in the country," notably concerning the presence of al Qaeda members in Malaysia. "The Economist" was reportedly being targeted for publishing an article about the situation of immigrant workers in the country. In Thailand, the government decided to expel Shawn Crispin and Rodney Tasker, two Bangkok-based journalists from the "Far Eastern Economic Review". The government first added their names to a list of "undesirable" foreigners. Immigration officials then confiscated their passports and revoked their visas.

*503  $aThe 2 July 2002 issue of the weekly newspaper "La Tribune" was been banned, apparently because it contained criticism of recent government efforts to interfere with the election of the president of the national bar association. The Interior Ministry refused to allow the 2 July 2002 issue of the French-language weekly newspaper "La Tribune" (no.165) to be printed, in accordance with Article 11 of the press law. The decision appears to have been prompted by an article in the issue entitled "Bar Association Election", which criticised the government's failed attempt to prevent Mahfoudh Ould Bettah's re-election as the association's president at a 27 June meeting. The managing editor of "La Tribune", Mohamed Fall Ould Oumere, was arrested on 12 April for investigating the activities of a non-officially recognised organisation called "Conscience et résistance". He was released on 21 April.

*503  $aThe Interior Ministry refused to authorise the printing of the Arabic-language edition of "Le Calame"'s issue 219 (dated 19 August), in accordance with Article 11 of the 1991 Press Law. The article in question states that the Interior Ministry may, by decree, "ban the circulation, distribution or sale of newspapers which jeopardize the credibility of the state". The ministry does not have to justify its decision and can simply send a written "notification" to the newspaper and printing press. The controversial issue of "Le Calame" included an article about the president's recent private trip to France, which was marked by demonstrations by Mauritanian opposition movements and French human rights organisations.

At least six newspapers have been censored by the Interior Ministry in the last 12 months. Two of them were banned in July 2002. Issue number 165 of La Tribune, a French-language weekly, which was due on 2 July, and issue number seven of Le Rénovateur, an independent bi-weekly, which was seized on 24 July.

That same day, members of the counter-espionage services (Direction de la surveillance du territoire, DST) were stationed outside publication director Lmrabet's home for the entire day. On 20 December, the Rabat administrative tribunal declared itself incapable of dealing with Lmrabet's complaint against the 8 December seizure of the newspaper. On 8 December, the newspaper was seized by police after going on sale. The authorities claim that Lmrabet did not pay his fine, even though the journalist's lawyer has assured that "the required sum was paid, despite the stalling and procrastination tactics of the Rabat Prosecutor's Office, led by the king's prosecutor, Abdeslam Imani."

The police also arrested Aqeel Najmi, editor of "Evening Special", and Hanif Dawami, editor of "Morning Special".

*503  $aDistribution of the national daily "Jurnalul National"'s 16 January edition was blocked by Conpress, a distribution company from the Constanza region that is owned in part by Mazare, the mayor of Constanza and a member of the Democratic Party. The same day, the mayor and his business associates also bought up all the copies of the newspaper that had been distributed by the state company Rodipet as soon as they hit the market. The newspaper's 16 January issue included an investigative report implicating the mayor in several cases involving the embezzlement of public monies. In addition, because Conpress considerably reduced its order of the newspaper's 17 January edition, "Jurnalul National" journalists distributed the newspaper in the streets at no charge. The 17 January edition again included the article incriminating Mazare. On 17 January, at about noon (local time), guards from a private security firm close to the mayor and Democratic Party officials forcibly entered the newspaper's local bureau. The journalists were told that the newspaper's rental agreement, valid until 2004, had been nullified, and that the building was being taken over by the Democratic Party. The journalists were then violently thrown out of the premises. They were not given the opportunity to take their computer equipment or work-related documents with them. Despite calls by editor-in-chief Ema Valentina Belet, the police did not intervene. "Jurnalul National"'s 18 January edition only included four pages, three of which were blank. The fourth page was titled, "This edition censored by Mayor Mazare".

*503  $aOn 7 June, a bailiff from the Basmanny court visited the offices of "Novaya Gazeta" and initiated proceedings for sealing the newspaper's property, which included conducting an inventory of the publication's property and sequestering it. "Novaya Gazeta"'s recent troubles began when a financial institution, Mezhprombank, sued the publication in Moscow's Basmanny court, claiming that one of its business deals had collapsed because of a December 2001 "Novaya Gazeta" article. The newspaper reported that Mezhprombank was immersed in a scandal involving Russian money laundering through the Bank of New York. "Novaya Gazeta" maintains that its reporting is accurate and contends that documents the paper procured demonstrate that it was not to blame for the collapse of the bank's business deal. Yet the Basmanny court refused to accept the documents as evidence. In February, the court ordered "Novaya Gazeta" to pay 15 million rubles (US dollars 482,309) in damages to the bank. As a small publication, "Novaya Gazeta" cannot afford such an outrageous fine and would be driven to bankruptcy if forced to pay. To prove its innocence, the newspaper sought to open a criminal fraud case against Mezhprombank with the Moscow prosecutor's office. However, the case file containing all documents disappeared unexpectedly.

*503  $aSince "Adige Heku" was launched in early 2001 in the small Caucasian republic of 800,000 people, it has battled constant official efforts to block its printing and distribution. Since it is excluded from the government-controlled distribution network, it is sold by independent street vendors but copies of it are continually seized. In January 2002, outgoing Kabardino-Balkaria President Valery Kokov stood for reelection despite a two-term limit stipulated in the Russian Federation's constitution. Hataschukov was detained several times after the newspaper ran articles about the views of opposition candidates and denounced Kokov's candidacy as illegal. Police repeatedly asked him who was funding the paper. The newspaper has not been able to publish since the beginning of the year, due to the systematic threats against its journalists and the owners of the offices it rents.

*503  $aOn 22 March 2002, the information minister censored "Al-Hayat". This decision was taken after Daoud Shurayan, the daily's Riyadh bureau chief, criticised the minister's comments on censorship during a meeting with local newspaper editors-in-chief. Moreover, the minister had recently prohibited the press from publishing his remarks. Daoud Shurayan noted that he did not consider what had been said to be "state secrets." In 2001, a royal decree authorised "Al-Hayat" (owned by the son of defence minister Prince Khaled bin Sultan), as well as other Saudi newspapers and another pan-Arab daily "Ash Sharq al-Awsat", to be distributed without advance censorship.

*503  $aIn February 2002, the private weekly "Regar" was found guilty of "libel" and sentenced to pay Vice President James Michel 500,000 euros (approx. US dollar 441,465) in damages. In November 2001, the newspaper published an article about the vice president's purchase, at a very low price, of a luxury home built at Sans Souci (Mahé Island) with government funds. This sentence, the latest of many, raises the total amount of damages the newspaper has to pay for "libel", or disrespecting the president and other high officials, to three million euros (approx. US dollar 2,648,000). The state has a de facto monopoly on all of the country's audiovisual media. The only television channel is public, and licence fees for radio stations are so high that it is almost impossible to create a private station. The only newspaper that refused to submit to institutionalised censorship was sentenced to pay three million euros in damages to the president and his entourage. For a newspaper that only publishes 3,000 copies, this is equivalent to a death certificate.

*503  $aThe Johannesburg High Court's banned on August 15 a biography written by former journalist Allan Greenblo on the life and dealings of businessman Sol Kerzner. This is the second time that the High Court has slapped a ban on the publication, distribution and marketing of the biography. In December 1997, the court issued an interdict against the publication of the first manuscript, allegedly because its contents were deemed libelous. Essentially, the court has twice made orders censoring the prior publication of information, contrary to the constitutional tenets of freedom of expression and media freedom. Sol Kerzner, a former proprietor of Sun International Hotels, has contended that the allegations made in the biography regarding his business dealings with the apartheid government, certain leaders of the former black "independent homelands" and the Comoros government are defamatory and injurious to his reputation.

They did not explain why, but said they would return them as soon as they had looked at them. However, they had not returned by 8:00 a.m. the next morning, so the newspaper was not published that day. The seizure is thought to have been prompted by the expected publication in the issue of a critical article about recent divisions within the main northern opposition party, El Umma. On 12 July, a faction led by Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi decided to ally itself with the government.

The newspaper's 4 September edition carried a speech by opposition leader Sadek El-Mahdi criticising the government's withdrawal from the talks. Another article reported on demands made by Abyei, a town bordering southern Sudan, inhabitants who want to belong to the south instead of the north.

On 19 December, the police went to the newspapers' printing houses and seized all copies of the edition in question. "Al-Horriya" editor-in-chief Saad Eddin Ibrahim said he was told the paper was seized because it had published an announcement by the Animal Resources Ministry denying rumours that a cattle illness had infected humans through meat and milk consumption. The government had previously banned articles about the alleged contamination. The two other newspapers were reportedly seized for the same reason.

*503  $aOn 30 December 2002, the independent daily newspaper "Al Watan" was closed, which the authorities say was shut down based on national security and state of emergency regulations. Also editions of two other independent newspapers, "Al Horriya" and "As Sahafa", failed to appear after having received threats from state security officials. The director-general of the internal security police ordered "Al Watan" to shut down on 28 December along with its publishing company, Compagnie de la Corne de l'Afrique. Adil Sid'Ahmed Khalifa, the newspaper's deputy editor, told that state security officials burst into the paper's offices and ordered staff to leave. On 30 December, the internal security office issued a statement justifying the action because the paper had printed "scores of articles on alleged corruption without providing substantive material to support them. The articles were printed to defame and tarnish the reputation of government institutions and individuals." The statement said that the paper had been found guilty in 20 court cases. Some of these instances concerned interviews with opposition leaders, including Turabi, and criticism of elections in Iraq. On 9 November, state security police arrested "Al Watan"'s editor-in-chief Sid'Ahmed Khalifa after publication of a report about police-student clashes at Khartoum University. His son Adil Sid'Ahmed Khalifa was summoned by police the same day and warned not to print any more articles on the clashes. He was arrested on 10 November. The two journalists were released on 12 November. Two other dailies, "Al Horriya" and "As Sahafa", failed to appear on 28 December after state security officials warned them on 27 December not to publish or else their Saturday editions would be seized. Editor Nureddin Madani and publisher Rabie Hamid, both from "As Sahafa", were summoned for questioning after printing a statement on 27 December by Turabi's banned Popular National Congress Party. The statement criticised the government's one-year renewal of the state of emergency. Saadeddine Ibrahim, "Al Horriya"'s editor-in-chief, was summoned about an article that accused the government of selling off the country's assets and embezzling huge sums of money.

*503  $aThe satirical weekly newspaper "Addomari" suspended its publication on 21 January 2002 following the authorities' introduction of strict new conditions for its distribution. The authorities are demanding that the satirical newspaper be distributed through the state company. Until now, the newspaper arranged its own distribution to subscribers and libraries. The state company explained that it sought to collect forty percent of the newspaper's earnings from sales and also wanted to distribute fewer copies of the newspaper. Since the newspaper does not receive any subsidies, Farzat, the weekly's owner, fears that this new distribution process will lead to heavy losses. As a consequence, on 21 January, he decided not to distribute the newspaper's most recent issue. The weekly is usually published on Mondays. Farzat appealed to the Ministry of Information, recalling that the publications law does not require private newspapers to be distributed through the state company. "Addomari" was launched in February 2001. The weekly is known for its criticism of the government. On 19 June, the authorities censored two pages of the newspaper, which included articles critical of the government. In February, the newspaper had a circulation of 60,000 copies.

National Security Bureau (NSB) agents seized the latest issue of the magazine, dated 21 March, which, according to the authorities, "endangered national security." Though 160,000 copies of the magazine were confiscated, "Next" magazine was still available in newsstands. The magazine's staff managed to make a second printing of the issue at an undisclosed location. "Next" magazine published a feature article on its front page titled "Lee Teng-hui Illegally Used 3 Billion Taiwanese Dollars". The article disclosed the existence of secret bank accounts used by former president Lee's government to finance spying missions in China and buy diplomatic relations with certain countries.

As such, it violated the Publishing Act of 1941. On 5 January, the Thai airline Thai International PLC barred the magazine's distribution on all its flights. On 7 January, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra announced that lawyers would study the magazine's articles in order to determine whether "defamation" charges should be filed against it.

The security forces briefly detained the director of "Motion d'information" following the article's publication. He spent one hour at Lomé's central prison for "undermining others' authority". On April 8, police seized most copies of the weekly Motion d'Information from newsstands after an article in the paper alleged that a dozen student activists with close ties to the opposition had evaded arrest, the African news agency PANAPRESS reported.

The author of the piece argued that the commission voted to halt investigations into human rights abuses in Togo because most of the states that participated in the vote were themselves human rights violators.

When summarizing the case, the judge stated that the reason for Öztoprak's acquittal was that the book had a small print-run of only 1,000 and would thereby not have sufficient impact.

*503  $aThe criminal prosecution of a Turkish publisher charged with "separatist propaganda" in connection with an American journalist's book about the Kurds. The trial of Abdullah Keskin, head of the Istanbul-based Avesta publishing house, begins Wednesday morning, April 3, in an Istanbul State Security Court. Keskin has been charged with disseminating "separatist propaganda," a crime under Article 8 of Turkey's Anti-Terror Law, because of Avesta's Turkish edition of After Such Knowledge, What Forgiveness?-My Encounters in Kurdistan, a book about the Kurds written by retired Washington Post correspondent Jonathan Randal. The state prosecutor's indictment cited several passages from the book that contained references to "Kurdistan." The trial against Keskin also opened on 3 April under Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law. He is accused in connection with the Turkish publication of a book by American author and former "Washington Post" correspondent Jonathan Randal entitled, "After Such Knowledge, What Forgiveness? My Encounters in Kurdistan". The book was originally published in English in 1997 and subsequently translated into Farsi, Italian and Arabic. Charges appear to relate to the author's references to "Kurdistan" in a number of passages. If convicted, Keskin could serve up to three years in prison. Randal was present at the first hearing but was not granted permission to testify in support of Keskin. This trial will resume on 7 June. On July 31, Abdullah Keskin, a Turkish publisher charged with "separatist propaganda" for publishing a U.S. journalist's book about Turkey's Kurdish minority population, was convicted and sentenced to a six-month prison sentence, which the court converted to a fine of about US$500. An Istanbul State Security Court ruled on Wednesday that Keskin had violated Article 8 of Turkey's Anti-Terror Law when his publishing house, Avesta, printed a Turkish edition of After Such Knowledge, What Forgiveness? My Encounters in Kurdistan, a book about the Kurds written by retired Washington Post correspondent Jonathan Randal. Keskin, who was out of the country and did not attend the hearing, will appeal the verdict, his lawyer said.

*503  $aOn October 10, three dozen police officers occupied the newsrooms of the private English-language daily Monitor and its sister station, Radio Monitor, which is headquartered in a suburb of the capital, Kampala. Authorities have accused the two news outlets of supporting "terrorists" by publishing "false news that alarmed the public." For five hours police searched the newspaper and the studio, which officials accuse of having ties to the Lord Resistance Army (LRA), an armed rebel group that has, for the last 20 years, called for a Christian fundamentalist republic of Uganda. The Monitor, Uganda's most influential daily, has not published since October 10. On 16 October, police officers finally left "The Monitor" offices, which they had occupied for nearly a week. The newspaper's staff began repairing the computer equipment and were able to produce a website edition the next day. The newspaper itself was expected to be back in circulation on 18 October.

*503  $aOn 21 March 2002, the newspaper "Te Fenua Fo'ou", a newspaper in the French Pacific territory of Wallis and Futuna, was shut down by the king of Wallis Island's traditional law enforcers. The move came amidst tension between the traditional ruler, called the "Lavelua", and the French publisher and editor of the newspaper. "Te Fenua Fo'ou" is published weekly from Wallis, home of the territorial capital, Mata Utu. It circulates in Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia, another French Pacific territory, where many people from Wallis and Futuna have migrated to work.. The king's customary police previously seized computer equipment and stopped publication of the 22 March edition of the newspaper. The move came amidst tension between the traditional ruler, called the "Lavelua", and the newspaper's publisher, Michel Bodineau, and editor-in-chief Gourlez. Both Bodineau and Gourlez are French. When Bodineau then printed and distributed an edition from another French territory, New Caledonia, the newspaper's Wallis headquarters were damaged and the phone line was ripped out. On 24 April 2002, "Te Fenua Fo'ou", weekly newspaper of the French Pacific territory of Wallis and Futuna, announced its closure. This followed pressure on the newspaper - the only one in the territory - from the traditional king of Wallis and attacks on its office.

*503  $aThe Ministry of Information issued an order for the indefinite closure of the newspaper on 3 February 2002. Seif al-Hadheri, "Al-Shumou"'s editor-in-chief, told that the ministry provided no explanation for its action and that officials refused to discuss the matter with him. He surmised that the closure came in response to "Al-Shumou"'s various "criticisms of government ministers." Mahboob Ali, head of the Yemeni Journalists Syndicate, said that Ministry of Information officials informed him that the newspaper was suspended for allegedly failing to comply with licensing procedures. Yemeni journalists and government officials have often criticized the newspaper as "unprofessional" in its news coverage.

*503  $aYouths from the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party destroyed hundreds of copies of the independent "The Daily News" in the town of Masvingo during a demonstration against alleged misinformation by the paper. On 27 December 2001, the youths, numbering over 100, took to the streets in Masvingo to protest what they alleged to be lies being published by the newspaper about the Zimbabwean government. The demonstrating youths, who were addressed by Masvingo's Provincial Governor Josiah Hungwe, spent the whole day chasing "The Daily News" vendors from the streets of Masvingo. According to the 28 December edition of "The Daily News", the youths, some as young as ten years old, said they had taken their instructions from ZANU-PF Chairperson for Masvingo and Higher Education Minister Samuel Mumbengegwi. Mumbengegwi is reported to have watched the mayhem from a distance.

*503  $aOn 10 January 2002, a number of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party's supporters tore up and burnt copies of the independent weekly newspapers "The Financial Gazette" and "The Daily News", according to a report in the 17 January edition of "The Financial Gazette". The incident occurred while the ZANU-PF supporters were on their way to Harare International Airport in hired buses to welcome Congolese President Joseph Kabila. While on its way to the airport, a crew from "The Financial Gazette" witnessed the destruction of the newspapers. The ruling party youths, who were wearing t-shirts with the ZANU-PF logo, got off a ZUPCO (Zimbabwe United Passenger Company Limited) bus with registration number 438-108 M on Chiremba road in the suburb of Hatfield. They then forced newspaper vendors to hand over large bundles of "The Daily News" and "The Financial Gazette", which they burnt publicly.

*503  $aMore than 100 copies of "The Daily News" were torn up and the newspaper's vendors were harassed in an attack by ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party youth. The incident occurred in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city, on 13 March 2002. "The Daily News" is an independent daily newspaper in Zimbabwe. Vendors were accused of supporting the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party. The youths threatened the vendors with "eviction from the streets." Similarly, on Friday 8 March, more than 150 copies of "The Daily News" newspaper were torn up by the youths in the high-density suburb of Lobengula and Herbert Chitepo streets, in the city centre. A vendor reported that his newspapers and daily takings were taken from him after he was accused of "insubordination". The "Daily News" reports that no arrests were made and the police refused to comment. On 9 October 2002, the privately-owned national daily newspaper "The Daily News" reported that a group of youths from the National Youth Service programme destroyed 450 copies of the paper in the eastern border town of Mutare. The confiscated copies are valued at US$500 at the official exchange rate.

*505  $aIn 1983, the magazine "Ikkevold" (Non Violence) published a critical review entitled "Bomb target Norway" (original title "Bombemål Norge") concerning the position Norway de facto held in the allied atomic strategy, as compared to the non-atomic defence policy adopted by the Norwegian Parliament. The Chief Prosecutor brought charges against the newspapers and editors/journalists involved of activities harmful to national security. The editorial staff of "Ikkevold" were found guilty by the County Court (Oslo) in 1985 and sentenced to jail. The sentence was appealed to the Supreme Court and consequently annulled. However, new charges were brought against the editorial staff, and in 1986 the County Court (Oslo) once more found them guilty as charged. Finally, all were acquitted by the Supreme Court in 1987.
