was originally to be produced and published by one single man, as a 
protest against the raids and executions in Randers. In January 1944 
the publisher established contact with Free Denmark. The paper was 
subsequently published by the "F.D."-group in Randers. During a Gestapo 
raid in 1944 one member was arrested. Another member was arrested 18 
March 1945 during a second raid. He was tortured and interned in the 
Danish camp Froeslev.

*505  $aThe paper was published in co-operation with the "Budstikken", 
"Med bud til alle danske", "Hjemmefronten" and "Studenternes 
efterretningstjeneste" from April 1944. Already prior to publishing 
the paper, a distribution-central was established; "Den Sjaellandske 
organisation". Over 2 million illegal papers were distributed through 
this central during the occupation. In January 1945 the group started 
making radio transmitters and receivers to the stations in Sjaelland. 
Furthermore, the group had at an early stage, established a 
Sweden-route. The news group was raided by the Gestapo several times, 
which resulted in the arrests and deportations of many group members, 
as well as the closing of the paper in February and March 1945. Of the 
deported co-workers, Kjeld Frederiksen died in Germany, and Joergen 
Arboe Rasmussen, who an informer revealed to the Gestapo, was shot 5 
February 1945.

*520  $aThis book investigates how the sexual element in Shakespeare's 
works is complicated and compromised by the impact of print. Whether the 
issue is one of censorship and evasion or sexual redefinition, the fact 
that Shakespeare wrote in the first century of popular print is crucial. 
Out of the newly-accessible classical canon he creates a reconstituted 
idea of the sexual temptress; and out of Counter-Reformation propaganda 
he fashions his own complex thinking about the prostitute. Shakespeare's 
theatrical scripts, meeting-ground for the spoken and written word, 
contribute powerfully to those socio-sexual debates which had been 
re-energized by print

*505  $aSuspended by the Military Junta ; Banned by the Authorities
*505  $aNational radio announced the decision of the military junta to 
suspend temporarily the privately-owned magazine "Standard Times". The 
magazine had published an article, entitled "Warlords want to invade 
Guinea", accusing the military junta and the Liberian government of 
supporting the son of the former President of Guinea in his plans to 
invade Guinea. According to the Commissioner of Information, the 
editors were asked to come to the Ministry of Information to reveal 
their sources; however, the journalists never showed up. The junta then 
suspended publication of the magazine for an indefinite period of time
*505  $aThe magazine "Standard Times" was banned for an indefinite 
period due to an article considered "offensive to the junta". The 
article quoted the deposed president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and criticised 
France and China for supporting the junta. Previously, on 12 November 
1997, national radio had announced the decision of the military 
authorities to temporarily suspend the magazine

November 1940 with the distribution of leaflets. Shortly afterwards 
they succeeded in building an organisation which by leaflets and 
proclamations informed the people. From August 1942 they started 
producing the paper, which published regularly until May 1945. In June 
1944 a daily news service was distributed: "Studenternes 
efterretningstjeneste, daglig information" and from January 1945 the 
paper: "S.E. oversigt, s.d.S.L.", which eventually included many groups 
in Copenhagen and the province, published from May 1944 to the 
capitulation in approx. 75 000 copies per issue.

*505  $aBanned by President Suharto's administration and the Ministry 
of Information
*505  $aTempo had a circulation of some 180000 copies when the Suharto 
government closed it down on June 21, 1994, citing vague "substantive" 
editorial reasons. Tempo's chief editor Gunawan Mohamad said that the 
precise reason for the 1994 ban remained unknown, but he speculated 
that the final blow might have been a report critical of the purchase 
by the government of 39 old East German navy vessels (ISAI)
*505  $aOn 3 May 1995, Indonesia's administrative court in Jakarta 
overturned the ban on "Tempo" magazine, imposed on 21 June 1994. The 
judge ordered the Ministry of Information to grant a new license to 
"Tempo", saying that the decree which revoked the permit was legally 
flawed. The Ministry of Information may appeal the judgement (A19).

*520  $aIn this lucid, disturbing, and provocative book, Joan 
Delfattore offers a behind-the-scenes view of the ways in which 
special-interest groups influence the content of textbooks used in 
public and private schools throughout the country. Efforts to censor 
elementary and high school textbooks have proliferated in the past 
decade. Most challenges have come from ultraconservative activists who 
oppose evolution, racial and ethnic equality, nontraditional gender 
roles, pacifism, and a host of other issues that contradict their 
religious, political, or social views. Other protests originate 
with ultraliberal activists whose goal is to eliminate all negative or 
traditional descriptions of racial, ethnic, religious, or gender groups, 
without regard for accuracy or historical context. DelFattore focuses on 
recent federal lawsuits involving attempts to censor or ban biology, 
geology, history, home economics, literature, psychology, reading, and 
social studies textbooks. She vividly re-creates the story behind each 
lawsuit, describing how politically sophisticated national organizations 
turn local controversies into nationally publicized court cases. She 
also discusses how both ultraliberal and ultraconservative groups in 
Texas and California pressure their state Boards of Education to demand 
that sections of textbooks be eliminated or rewritten as a condition of 
selling the books in those states. Because California and Texas are such 
important markets, says DelFattore, publishers almost always make the 
required changes in the books, which are then sold nationwide. As a 
result, the content of American textbooks is heavily influenced by 
political and economic forces as well as by educational considerations. 
DelFattore's investigation has profound implications not only for 
education but also for freedom of thought in the larger society. Her 
book will be mandatory reading for parents, teachers, school 
administrators, lawyers, librarians, and other concerned citizens.

*505  $aThe Commissar Vanishes offers a chilling look at how one man - 
Joseph Stalin -manipulated the science of photography to advance his 
own political career and to erase the memory of his victims. On Stalin's 
orders, purged rivals were airbrushed from group portraits, and 
crowdscenes were altered to depict even greater legions of the 
faithful. In one famous image, several Partymembers disappeared from an 
official photograph, to be replaced by a sylvan glade. For the 
past three decades, author and photohistorian David King has assembled 
the world's largest archive of photographs, posters, and paintings from 
the Soviet era. His collection has grown to more than a quarter of a 
million images, the best of which have been selected for The Commissar 
Vanishes
*520 8$aThe efforts of the Kremlin airbrushers were often 
unintentionally hilarious. A 1919photograph showing a large crowd of 
Bolsheviks clustered around Lenin, for example, became, with the aid of 
the retoucher, an intimate portrait of Lenin and Stalin sitting alone, 
and then, in a later version, of Stalin by himself. The Commissar 
Vanishes is nothing less than the history of the Soviet Union, as retold 
through falsified images, many of them published here for the first 
time outside Russia. In each case, the juxtaposition of the original and 
the doctored images yields a terrifying - and often tragically funny 
-insight into one of the darkest chapters of modern history
